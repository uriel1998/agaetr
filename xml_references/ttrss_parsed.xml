<p>The nine-page response released Monday reiterates the House Democrats&rsquo; argument in a<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/house-democrats-legal-brief-senate-impeachment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> trial brief</a> sent Saturday evening that Trump &ldquo;jeopardized our national security and our democratic self-governance&rdquo; and &ldquo;used his Presidential powers to orchestrate a cover-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Trump maintains that the Senate cannot remove him even if the House proves every claim in the Articles of impeachment. That is a chilling assertion. It is also dead wrong,&rdquo; the impeachment managers wrote. &ldquo;The Framers deliberately drafted a Constitution that allows the Senate to remove Presidents who, like President Trump, abuse their power to cheat in elections, betray our national security, and ignore checks and balances. That President Trump believes otherwise, and insists he is free to engage in such conduct again, only highlights the continuing threat he poses to the Nation if allowed to remain in office. &rdquo;</p>
<p>The response also took issue with Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;stonewalling of the impeachment inquiry&rdquo; and argued that &ldquo;the Senate should require the President to turn over the documents he is hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should hear from witnesses, as it has done in every impeachment trial in American history; it especially should hear from witnesses the President blocked from testifying in the House,&rdquo; the impeachment managers wrote.</p>
<p>The House Democrats&rsquo; response came shortly after&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s legal team urged the Senate to &ldquo;<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-legal-brief-senate-impeachment-trial" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swiftly and roundly condemn</a>&rdquo; the articles of impeachment that it characterized as &ldquo;flimsy&rdquo; in a brief filed to the Senate Monday.</p>

<p>Sociologists
studying emotion have opened up the inner, private feelings of anger, fear,
shame, and love to reveal the far-reaching effects of social forces on our most
personal experiences. This subfield has given us new words to make sense of shared
experiences: emotional labor in our professional lives, collective
effervescence at sporting events and concerts, emotional capital as a resource
linked to gender, race, and class, and the relevance of power in shaping
positive and negative emotions. </p>



<p>Despite
these advances, scholars studying emotion still struggle to capture emotion
directly. In the lab, we can elicit certain emotions, but by removing context,
we remove much of what shapes real-life experiences. In surveys and interviews,
we can ask about emotions retrospectively, but rarely in the moment and in
situ. </p>



<p>One
way to try to capture emotions as they unfold in all of their messy glory is
through audio diaries (Theodosius 2008). Our team set out to use audio
diaries as a way to understand the emotions of hospital nurses&mdash;workers on the
front lines of healthcare. We asked nurses to make a minimum of one recording
after each of 6 consecutive shifts. Some made short 10-minute recordings. Some
talked for hours in the midst of beeping hospital machines and in break rooms,
while walking to their cars, driving home, and as they unplugged after a long
day. With the recorders out in the world, we couldn&rsquo;t control what they
discussed. We couldn&rsquo;t follow-up with probing questions or ask them to move to
a quieter location to minimize background noise. </p>



<p>But what this lack of control gave us was a trove of emotions and reflections, experienced and processed while recording. One fruitful way to try to distill these data, we found, was through visuals. We created wavelength visualizations in order to augment our interpretation of diary transcripts. Pairing the two reintroduces some of the &lsquo;texture&rsquo; of spoken word often lost in the transcription process (Smart 2009:296). The following is from our new article in the journal, <em>Qualitative Research</em> (Cottingham and Erickson Forthcoming).</p>



<p>In this first segment, Tamara (all participant names are pseudonyms) describes a memorable situation in which a patient&rsquo;s visitor assumed that Tamara was a lower-level nursing aid rather than a registered nurse (the full event is discussed in greater detail in Cottingham, Johnson, and Erickson 2018). This caused her to feel &ldquo;ticked&rdquo; (angry), which is the word she uses after a quick, high-pitched laugh that peaks the wavelength just after the 30-s mark (Figure 1). The wavelength peak just after the 1:15 mark is as she says the word &lsquo;why&rsquo; with notable agitation in &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure <em>why</em>. Maybe cuz I&rsquo;m Black. I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; </p>



<figure><img src="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/ticked-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/ticked-1.png 864w, https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/ticked-1-500x107.png 500w, https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/ticked-1-768x164.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Figure 1. Tamara&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ticked&rdquo; Segment (shift 2, part 1)</figcaption></figure>



<p>We can compare Figure 1 that visualizes Tamara&rsquo;s feelings of
anger with the visualization of emotion in Figure 2. &ldquo;Draining&rdquo; is the
description Tamara gives at the beginning of this second segment. The peak just
after the 15-second mark is from a breathy laugh as she describes her sister &ldquo;who
has MS is sitting on the bedside commode&rdquo; when she gets home from work. After
the 45-second mark, she has a similar breathy laugh but in conjunction with the
word &lsquo;compassionate&rsquo; as she says &lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to be as empathetic and
compassionate as I want to be, but I know I&rsquo;m really not. So I feel kinda
crappy, guilty maybe about that.&rsquo; Just before the 1:30 mark she draws out the
words &lsquo;draining&rsquo; and &lsquo;frustrating&rsquo; before finishing: &lsquo;because you leave it and
you come home to it&hellip;you know&hellip;yeah.&rsquo; We can see that the segment ends with
longer pauses, muted remarks, and sighs, suggesting low energy and representing
the drained feelings she expresses, particularly in comparison to the lively
energy seen in the first segment when she discusses feeling angry. </p>

Tamara&rsquo;s &ldquo;Draining&rdquo; Segment (shift 2, part 2)</figcaption></figure>



<p>A second example comes from Leah, recorded while driving to work. Here she is angry (&ldquo;pissed off&rdquo;) because she has to work on a day that she was not originally scheduled to work. This segment is visualized in the waveform shown in Figure 3. </p>



<figure><img src="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/indignation-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/indignation-3.png 864w, https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/indignation-3-500x114.png 500w, https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/indignation-3-768x175.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Figure 3. Leah&rsquo;s &lsquo;Righteous Indignation&rsquo; Segment (shift 2, part 1)</figcaption></figure>



<figure><img src="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/stay-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/stay-4.png 864w, https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/stay-4-500x106.png 500w, https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2019/11/stay-4-768x163.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Figure 4. Leah&rsquo;s &lsquo;I Don&rsquo;t Want to Stay&rsquo; Segment (shift 2, part 3)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In contrast to her discussion of being pissed off and working to &lsquo;retain enough righteous indignation&rsquo; to confront her boss later (in figure 3), we see a different wavelength visualization in her second segment (figure 4). In that segment, she describes her lack of enthusiasm for continuing the shift. She reflects on this lack of desire (&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stay&rsquo;) by stepping outside her own feelings and contrasting them with the dire circumstances of her young patient. This reflexivity leads her to conclude that she has reached the limits of her ability to be compassionate. </p>



<p>To
be sure, waveform visualizations are only meaningful in tandem with <em>what</em> our nurses say. And they do not
provide definitive proof of certain emotions over others. They can&rsquo;t fully
identify the sighs, deep inhales, uses of sarcasm, or other subtle features of
spoken diary entries. They do, however, offer some insight into how speed,
pitch, and pauses correspond to different emotional expressions and, arguably,
levels of emotional energy (Collins 2004) that vary across time and interactions.
</p>



<p>While
there is little that can serve as a substitute for hearing the recordings
directly, the need to protect participants&rsquo; confidentiality compels us to turn
to other means to convey the nuances of these verbalizations. Visualization of
wavelengths, in combination with transcripts, can lend themselves to further
qualitative interpretation of these subtleties, conveying the dynamics of a
segment to others who do not have direct access to the recordings themselves.</p>

	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Leia Organa is a character that has meant the absolute world to me since I first saw&nbsp;Star War...</p>]]></summary>

<p>Leia Organa is a character that has meant the absolute world to me since I first saw&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>as a child. A woman who wasn&rsquo;t afraid of wearing a dress and kicking ass, there was something about her that I loved with my whole heart. Years later, I&rsquo;d discover that I&rsquo;m more of a Carrie Fisher than I am a Leia Organa, but that love would never wane.</p>
<p>What it meant, though, is that I would defend Leia with all my might, including when people would laugh at the idea of Leia being the hero in <em>A New Hope</em>. When we first meet Leia, she&rsquo;s captured by Darth Vader, tortured, and forced to watch her planet get destroyed, and yet when Luke Skywalker comes to &ldquo;save her,&rdquo; she&rsquo;s casual and relaxing, as if it isn&rsquo;t a bother to her.</p>
<p>In fact, when she starts to follow Luke and Han to try to get back to the Falcon, it&rsquo;s Leia who gets them out of the way of the Stormtroopers because, otherwise, they would have been shot and killed right then and there.</p>
<p>Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker himself) wants to make one thing clear: without Leia, <em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>would have been just that quick little beginning part of&nbsp;<em>A New Hope&nbsp;</em>and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I think Luke &amp; Han are lucky Leia took over their &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; on the Death Star or it would&rsquo;ve been a very short movie. <a href="https://t.co/GFauW2LBEE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://t.co/GFauW2LBEE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) <a href="https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/1215069196121280512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">January 9, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p>While being the good human being he is, Hamill was trying to tell a young fan that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars </em>is for everyone, not just &ldquo;boys.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a mindset that has permeated the <em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>fandom for years, resulting in many fans (myself included) being laughed at when we point out that Leia saved both Han and Luke on the Death Star.</p>
<p>So, to see Mark Hamill take to Twitter to share that same thought? It hit me in a way I didn&rsquo;t expect (meaning I cried) because finally, it wasn&rsquo;t just fans of Leia screaming into the void. Luke Skywalker himself is on our side and agrees that Luke Skywalker and Han Solo <em>needed </em>Leia Organa to succeed.</p>
<p>For me, Leia has always been this hero that I never could aspire to be. I loved her because she was always willing to do the necessary thing to see the imperial reign end. Much like Carrie Fisher herself, she didn&rsquo;t like the man who put himself before the needs of the many. (Please go back and look at how much Carrie Fisher hated Donald Trump. I miss her tweets about him).</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s just something so heartwarming about seeing Mark Hamill express something that many of us have been saying for years. I guess, in a way, it makes me not feel like I&rsquo;m yelling at a brick wall. Being a female fan of <em>Star Wars</em>, unfortunately, has not been easy. We&rsquo;re often quizzed or told we&rsquo;re wrong about something we&rsquo;re right about (I&rsquo;ll never forget when someone told me that I was wrong and Han Solo wasn&rsquo;t Corellian, when he &hellip; wears a Corellian blood stripe), and to see Mark Hamill siding with those of us who call Leia a hero? It makes me proud to be his fan.</p>
<p>I miss Leia and Carrie Fisher more and more each day, but I know she&rsquo;d retweet Mark with some emojis that said something like &ldquo;fucking right she did,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s why I love her.</p>

Unlike other types of ads or political content, Facebook does not apply third-party fact-checking to political ads posted by candidates. Facebook&rsquo;s own <span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-employees-criticize-social-networks-policy-that-lets-politicians-lie-in-ads/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employees have spoken out against this stance</a></span>, and several presidential candidates have even run ads with openly false information in an effort to show how dangerous Facebook&rsquo;s policy can be, but so far there&rsquo;s no indication the company will make any changes.</p><p>Now, if you&rsquo;re like me, the threat of seeing constant arguments and misleading ads clogging up your timeline is enough to <span><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-delete-your-facebook-account-a-checklist-1829436824" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swear Facebook off entirely</a></span>&mdash;or at least <span><a href="https://lifehacker.com/dont-delete-facebook-just-be-smarter-on-facebook-1823922407" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">impose strict limits on yourself</a></span>. </p><p>However, for those who still want to use the platform but avoid political ads, fake news, or general partisan vitriol, there aren&rsquo;t many options available in Facebook&rsquo;s settings. Sure, you can <span><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-fight-back-against-data-broker-advertising-on-fa-1836319326" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tailor your advertising information</a></span>, and you can block, unfollow, or unfriend any person or page you no longer want to see, but those options will only do so much. </p><p>Instead, I would suggest trying the third-party browser extension F.B. Purity , which is <span><a href="https://www.fbpurity.com/install.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">available for the desktop versions of Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Safari, Opera, and more</a></span> (though not mobile, sadly). </p><p>F.B. Purity adds a new menu to the Facebook UI filled with customization options that change what you do and don&rsquo;t see on the site. For example, you can disable auto-playing videos, hide entire menus, and even change how notifications are displayed. </p><figure><div><span><div><div><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div></div></span><figcaption>Screenshot: Brendan Hesse</figcaption></div><span></span></figure><p>Most importantly for those who want to block out some of the political nonsense, F.B. Purity can hide ads, block posts using keywords, and apply stricter filtering to news posts the appear in your timeline, among <span><a href="https://www.fbpurity.com/faq.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many other tweaks</a></span>. You&rsquo;ll want to familiarize yourself with the extension before diving in, but the interface is mostly self-explanatory.</p><p>I was able to trim down Facebook&rsquo;s UI quite a bit using F.B. Purity. In fact, as someone who barely logs in anymore, I was actually surprised by how much cleaner and pleasant Facebook looks with even the default F.B. Purity settings applied. It basically removed the entire right-side menus and ads&mdash;and that was before I added a few keywords to my blocklist. </p><p>Ultimately, I still think simply avoiding Facebook&mdash;or at the very least just not engaging with political posts&mdash;is the best course of action, but I&rsquo;m confident that F.B. Purity can help as the 2020 political din gets louder... At least for a little while. Facebook is really good at circumventing other ad and content-blocking extensions, so it&rsquo;s possible that F.B. Purity won&rsquo;t always work. That said, unless Facebook changes its policies or adds more ways for users to customize their experience, it&rsquo;s probably your best shot for now.</p></div>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<div><figure><div><span><div><div><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div></div></span><figcaption>Photo: <span><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/head-shot-side-view-angry-african-1470405188" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shutterstock</a></span></figcaption></div><span></span></figure><span></span><p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the premise of the U.S. Government&rsquo;s <span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/lifeline-support-affordable-communications" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lifeline Assistance</a></span> program. It allows those with substantially low incomes&mdash;135 percent or less than the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or less than $16,862 for a single-person household&mdash;to receive discounted or free phones and wireless services.<br></p><p>However, when one of the phones being offered comes with malware preinstalled, that&rsquo;s a big problem. At least, that&rsquo;s the assertion from MalwareBytes, which noticed some issues with apps preinstalled on the one such phone, the Unimax U686CL sold by Virgin Mobile&rsquo;s <span><a href="https://www.assurancewireless.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Assurance Wireless</a></span>. And <span><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/android/2020/01/united-states-government-funded-phones-come-pre-installed-with-unremovable-malware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here&rsquo;s what it found</a></span>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;The first questionable app found on the UMX U686CL poses as an updater named Wireless Update. Yes, it is capable of updating the mobile device. In fact, it&rsquo;s the only way to update the mobile device&rsquo;s operating system (OS). Conversely, it is also capable of auto-installing apps without user consent.</em></p><p><em>Thus, we detect this app as Android/PUP.Riskware.Autoins.Fota.fbcvd, a detection name that should sound familiar to Malwarebytes for Android customers. That&rsquo;s because the app is actually a variant of Adups, a China-based company caught collecting user data, creating backdoors for mobile devices and, yes, developing auto-installers.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>And that&rsquo;s not all. A second app found on the smartphone&mdash;its own Settings app, no less&mdash;was actually a trojan dropper that MalwareBytes classifies as &ldquo;Android/Trojan.Dropper.Agent.UMX.&rdquo; Once it loads, it drops a second piece of malware on users&rsquo; phones (the third in total, if we&rsquo;re counting) that will then fill your device full of annoying advertising. Fun.</p><p>In a statement, Assurance Wireless told <span><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/unremovable-malware-found-preinstalled-on-low-end-smartphone-sold-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ZDNet</a></span> that they are &ldquo;aware of this issue and are in touch with the device manufacturer Unimax to understand the root cause, however, after our initial testing we do not believe the applications described in the media are malware.&rdquo;</p><aside><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-if-an-android-app-is-strandhogg-malware-in-1840172627" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><div><div><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div></div><span></span></a><div><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-if-an-android-app-is-strandhogg-malware-in-1840172627" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><p>&lsquo;StrandHogg&rsquo; sounds like something out of Quake II, but it&rsquo;s actually the name of a new Android&hellip;</p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tell-if-an-android-app-is-strandhogg-malware-in-1840172627" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read more</a></div></aside><h3>There&rsquo;s an easy fix for this, right?</h3><p>Here&rsquo;s the worst news: There&rsquo;s nothing you can really do about these preinstalled problems in this case. You <em>could</em> theoretically get rid of the Wireless Updates app, but then your device won&rsquo;t receive any updates, and that&rsquo;s a security (and features) problem in itself. Remove Settings, and even I&rsquo;m not sure what would happen to your phone. I suspect it would become inoperable.</p><p>Malwarebytes does offer some Frankenstein-like solutions, whereby you attempt to uninstall the offending app and replace it with a clean, identical version of the same app. It&rsquo;s <span><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2019/01/the-new-landscape-of-preinstalled-mobile-malware-malicious-code-within/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lot of work</a></span> with no guarantee of success; so much so, that even Malwarebytes concedes that your best route to deal with preinstalled malware on your smartphone is to simply avoid smartphones with these issues.</p><p>That&rsquo;s easier said than done, though. If you&rsquo;ve been using a UMX U686CL, you&rsquo;re already infected. It&rsquo;s unclear what, if any, additional malware applications have been loaded onto your device, but I would strongly urge you to upload your critical data somewhere else&mdash;either to a connected computer or the cloud&mdash;and factory-reset your phone. After that, return it to wherever you purchased it. If that&rsquo;s not possible, recycle it and buy something else.</p><aside><a href="https://lifehacker.com/this-new-android-malware-can-survive-a-factory-reset-1839471462" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><div><div><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div></div><span></span></a><div><a href="https://lifehacker.com/this-new-android-malware-can-survive-a-factory-reset-1839471462" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><p>Here&rsquo;s a fun one: There&rsquo;s new Android malware making the rounds that is not only irritating&mdash;thanks, </p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/this-new-android-malware-can-survive-a-factory-reset-1839471462" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read more</a></div></aside><h3>If you buy another budget smartphone...</h3><p>Should you get another budget phone? You certainly can; however, Malwarebytes notes that it has seen more budget android devices arrive with preinstalled malware lately. It only takes <span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-new-reason-to-not-buy-these-cheap-android-devices-co-1826289219" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a quick search or two</a></span> to find many more reports of this practice. </p><p>If you opt for another, you should install Malwarebytes&rsquo; <span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.malwarebytes.antimalware&amp;referrer=af_tranid%3D13r8khvPDPycyJwDlSF4kQ%26shortlink%3D516cebeb%26pid%3DIRIS%26c%3DIRIS-free-download-Oct-18%26af_web_id%3Dadf088c1-ec8d-4ce5-86b5-7bdb4049af41-o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android app</a></span> and see if it finds anything&mdash;don&rsquo;t spring for the premium package, which is unnecessary if you&rsquo;re trying to root out preinstalled problems. Otherwise, I recommend setting a <span><a href="https://www.google.com/alerts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google alert</a></span> for your smartphone&rsquo;s model (like &ldquo;UMX U686CL&rdquo;), so you can get a quick notification if, or when, someone else discovers a problem on your device. </p><p>And, as always, if you notice something suspicious on your phone&mdash;weirdly named apps that weren&rsquo;t there before, new advertisements appearing out of nowhere, things like that&mdash;odds are good you have a malware problem on your hands. You might want to do some additional investigating, resist the urge to give your device more personal data (like your social security number or credit card information), and possibly start shopping for another smartphone.</p></div>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<div><p>An <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/android/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a> phone subsidized by the US government for low-income users comes preinstalled with malware that can't be removed without making the device cease to work, researchers reported on Thursday.</p><div><p>ARS TECHNICA</p><p>This story originally appeared on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/us-government-funded-android-phones-come-preinstalled-with-unremovable-malware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond&eacute; Nast.</p></div><p>The UMX U686CL is provided by Virgin Mobile's Assurance Wireless program. Assurance Wireless is an offshoot of the Lifeline Assistance program, a Federal Communications Commissions plan that makes free or government-subsidized phone service available to <a href="https://www.obamaphone.com/what-is-the-obama-phone" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions of low-income families.</a> The program is often referred to as the Obama Phone because it expanded in 2008, when President Barack Obama took office. The UMX U686CL runs Android and is available for $35 to qualifying users.</p><p>Researchers at Malwarebytes <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/android/2020/01/united-states-government-funded-phones-come-pre-installed-with-unremovable-malware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Thursday</a> that the device comes with some nasty surprises. Representatives of Sprint, the owner of Virgin Mobile, meanwhile said it didn't believe the apps were malicious.</p><p>The first is heavily obfuscated malware that can install adware and other unwanted apps without the knowledge or permission of the user. Android/Trojan.Dropper.Agent.UMX contains striking similarities to two other trojan droppers. For one, it uses identical text strings and almost identical code. And for another, it contains an encoded string that, when decoded, contains a hidden library named com.android.google.bridge.Liblmp.</p><p>Once the library is loaded into memory, it installs software Malwarebytes calls Android/Trojan.HiddenAds. It aggressively displays ads. Malwarebytes researcher Nathan Collier said company users have reported that the hidden library installs a variant of HiddenAds, but the researchers were unable to reproduce that installation, possibly because the library waits some amount of time before doing so.</p><p>The malware that installs these programs is hidden in the phone's settings app. That makes it virtually impossible to uninstall, since the phone can't operate properly without it. "Uninstall the Settings app, and you just made yourself a pricey paper weight," Collier wrote.</p><p>The second unpleasant surprise delivered by the UMX U686CL is something called Wireless Update. While it provides a mechanism for downloading and installing phone updates, it also loads a barrage of unwanted apps without permission. The app is a variant of Adups, an app from a China-based company by the same name. In 2016, researchers caught Adups <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/chinese-company-installed-secret-backdoor-on-hundreds-of-thousands-of-phones/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surreptitiously collecting user data</a> on hundreds of thousands of low-cost phones from BLU.</p><p>"From the moment you log into the mobile device, Wireless Update starts auto-installing apps," Collier said. "To repeat: There is no user consent collected to do so, no buttons to click to accept the installs, it just installs apps on its own."</p><p>While all of the installed apps Malwarebytes examined were clean and free of malware, the presence of a feature that automatically installs apps poses an unacceptable risk, particularly since removing the feature prevents the phone from receiving updates. Collier's post classified Wireless Update as malware, but J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Segura, Malwarebytes' head of threat intelligence, told me its actual classification is a PUP, or potentially unwanted program, since there's no evidence the apps that are installed are malicious.</p><p>In any event, the two apps analyzed by Malwarebytes make use of the UMX U686CL a bad choice. The fact that it's made available to low-income users only worsens the insult. Malwarebytes said it notified Assurance Wireless of its findings and asked why the phone it sells comes with preinstalled malware. So far, no one has responded. In an email, Sprint officials said: "We are aware of this issue and are in touch with the device manufacturer Unimax to understand the root cause, however, after our initial testing we do not believe the applications described in the media are malware."</p><p>It's not hard to find online discussions <a href="https://androidforums.com/threads/obamaphone-service-through-virgin-mobile-annoying-ads.1245098/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like this one</a> complaining of annoying displayed ads and apps automatically installing on the device without user permission. A <a href="https://androidforums.com/threads/ads-poping-up-on-home-screen-fix.1189560/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar thread</a> discusses ads that display on the homescreen even when a browser isn't running.</p><p>Over the years, preinstalled malware has been found on a raft of low-cost Android phones from a variety of providers and manufacturers. An incomplete list includes a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/chinese-company-installed-secret-backdoor-on-hundreds-of-thousands-of-phones/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backdoor on hundreds of thousands of BLU devices</a>, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/powerful-backdoorrootkit-found-preinstalled-on-3-million-android-phones/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">powerful backdoor and rootkit also on BLU devices</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/12/covert-downloaders-found-preinstalled-on-dozens-of-low-cost-android-phone-models/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">covert downloaders on 26 different phone models</a> from various manufacturers.</p><p>It seems the price people often pay for low-cost phones is compromised security and privacy. While many users may not be able to afford them, buying phones from mainstream and well-known providers located outside of China is likely to be a better choice.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/us-government-funded-android-phones-come-preinstalled-with-unremovable-malware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>.</em></p><p>More Great WIRED Stories</p></div>]]></content>

	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This story originally appeared on Yale Environment 360 and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<div><p><em>This story originally appeared on <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/climate-whiplash-wild-swings-in-extreme-weather-are-on-the-rise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yale Environment 360</a> and is part of the <a href="https://www.climatedesk.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Climate Desk</a> collaboration.</em></p><p>From 2011 to 2016, California experienced <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/thanks-el-nino-californias-drought-probably-forever/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five years of extreme drought</a>, during which numerous high temperature records were broken. These hot, dry years were followed by the extremely wet winter of 2016 -2017, when, from October to March, an average of 31 inches of rain fell across the state, the second highest winter rainfall on record.</p><p>All that rain meant a bumper crop of grasses and other vegetation, which, as hot and dry conditions returned, likely contributed to a combustible mix of fuels that played a role in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/californias-wildfires-are-the-doom-of-our-own-making/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">severe fires</a> that have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/kincade-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swept California</a> in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-california-needs-to-adapt-to-survive-future-fires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">past two years</a>.</p><p>These wild swings from one weather extreme to another are symptomatic of a phenomenon, variously known as &ldquo;climate whiplash&rdquo; or &ldquo;weather whiplash,&rdquo; that scientists say is likely to increase as the world warms. The intensity of wildfires these days in places like California are a symptom of climate change, experts say, but the whiplash effect poses a different set of problems for humans and natural systems. Researchers project that by the end of this century, the frequency of these abrupt transitions between wet and dry will increase by 25 percent in Northern California and as much as double in Southern California if greenhouse gasses continue to increase.</p><p>&ldquo;There has been an assumption that the main thing we have to contend with climate change is increased temperatures, decreased snowpack, increased wildfire risk&rdquo; on the West Coast, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. &ldquo;Those things are still true, but there is this other dimension we will have to contend with &mdash; the increased risk of extreme flood and drought, and rapid transitions between the two.&rdquo;</p><p>Last year in Montecito, California, one of the state&rsquo;s worst wildfires swept through the region. Weeks later, torrential rains fell on the burned ground, causing mudslides <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/post-wildfire-mudslide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that wiped out houses and killed 21 people</a>. In Europe this year, late spring frosts that damaged crops were followed by heavy rains that washed the crops out of the ground and flooded fields for weeks.</p><p>In the future, weather whiplash could mean an intense drought year followed by record rains that don&rsquo;t allow planting or that wash fertilizer into waterways. Extreme swings between freezing and thawing can kill buds on trees, or lead to rain in northerly climes that is followed by freezing weather, forming a barrier of ice that prevents foraging animals like caribou from reaching vital winter browse.</p><p>Tree ring data shows a significant increase in climate volatility in the last 60 years in Europe. The North Atlantic Jet Stream fluctuates between the Balkans to the south and Scotland to the north. Some 300 years of tree ring samples taken in both places show that the jet stream has become far more variable in the last six decades and more extreme in its positions, which results in more severe climate events and a more rapid shifting between extremes on yearly, monthly, and weekly timescales.</p><p>&ldquo;The timing of the changes suggests that it&rsquo;s anthropogenic,&rdquo; said Valerie Trouet, who studies climate at the University of Arizona&rsquo;s Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research.</p><p>Experts say one cause of climate whiplash may be warming-related disruptions in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/polar-vortex-chicago-flights-cancelled-cold-why/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the polar vortex</a>, which in turn affects <a href="https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/jet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the jet stream</a>. The vortex is a wall of wind that constantly circles the Arctic and prevents warm air from penetrating the cold regions, and cold air from moving south. When it is stable, the polar vortex produces normal, seasonal weather. But an unstable polar vortex causes abnormal and extreme weather.</p></div>]]></content>
