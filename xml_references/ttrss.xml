      <![CDATA[<p>It's not surprising that Trump used his own charity like a personal piggy bank. Nor is it surprising that his base loves him all the more for stealing the money. What <em>is</em> surprising is that there was still almost $2 million left in the charity's account. I guess <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trumps-businesses-are-full-of-dirty-russian-money-the-scandal-is-thats-legal/2019/03/29/11b812da-5171-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he'll be heading to Moscow again soon</a>, MAGA hat in hand.</p>
               <p>From <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/12/trump-pays-usd2-million-fine-for-abusing-his-own-charity.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Intelligencer</a>:</p>
               <blockquote><p>A judge ordered the payment last month after Trump admitted to abusing the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which he used over the years to buy a portrait of himself and a Broncos helmet autographed by Tim Tebow, among other noncharitable items.</p>
               <p>The foundation, which has been shut down, also distributed the $1.8 million left in its coffers to the eight charities, giving them each a total of $476,140.41. The charities are Army Emergency Relief, the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society, Citymeals on Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha&rsquo;s Table, the United Negro College Fund, United Way of the National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.</p></blockquote>
               <p>The NY attorney general's office also said that Don Jr, Eric, and Ivanka, who were officials with the foundation, took &ldquo;compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again.&rdquo; Thank goodness this type of illegal activity will never take place again!</p>

               <blockquote><p><em>Gross: So how do you cast a cat for your film?</em></p>
               <p><em>One Coen brother: Ooh, that was horrible. We just used on the advice of the trainer&mdash;the animal trainer, kind of an orange, kind of a marmalade tabby cat, just because they are, you know, common, and so easy to double, triple, quadruple. There were, you know, many cats playing the one cat and, you know, the whole thing is actually pretty, it comes across well in the movie, but the whole exercise of shooting a cat is pretty nightmarish because they don't care about anything; they don't want to do what you want them to do. As the animal trainer said to us, a dog wants to please you; a cat only wants to please itself. It was just long, painstaking, frustrating days shooting the cat.</em></p>
               <p><em>Other Coen brother: What you have to do is basically find the cat that's predisposed to doing whatever particular piece of action it is that you have to film. So you find the cat that can&mdash;isn't afraid to run down a fire escape or this, you know, the cat that's very docile and will let the actor just hold them for extended periods of time without being fidgety. And then you want the fidgety cat&mdash;the squirrely cat&mdash;for when you want the cat to run away and you just keep swapping them out&mdash;depending on what the task at hand is.</em></p></blockquote>

               <p><a href="https://www.themarysue.com/donald-trump-obsessed-obama-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Once again</a>, Donald Trump is telling the whole world how jealous he is of President Obama.</p>
               <p>At the U.N. General Assembly Monday, a Pakistani journalist told Trump that he would be deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize if he committed to mediate India and Pakistan&rsquo;s attempts to work out a decades-old contention over the territory of Kashmir. Trump responded by saying there are plenty of things he could win a Nobel Prize for, but the system is rigged against him.</p>
               <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things&mdash;if they gave it out fairly, which they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>
               <p>His proof? Barack Obama was given one in 2009. And if Obama has something Trump doesn&rsquo;t, clearly it&nbsp;<em>must</em> be deliberate discrimination.</p>
               <p>&ldquo;They gave one to Obama immediately after his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You know what, that was the only thing I agreed with him on.&rdquo;</p>
               <p>In reality, Obama was given the award in his first year as President thanks to his &ldquo;extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.&rdquo;</p>
               <p><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2009/press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here&rsquo;s what the committee wrote</a> at the time:</p>
               <blockquote><p>Obama has as President created a new climate in international politics. Multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play. Dialogue and negotiations are preferred as instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts. The vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations. Thanks to Obama&rsquo;s initiative, the USA is now playing a more constructive role in meeting the great climatic challenges the world is confronting. Democracy and human rights are to be strengthened.</p></blockquote>
               <p>&ldquo;Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world&rsquo;s attention and given its people hope for a better future,&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world&rsquo;s population.&rdquo;</p>
               <p>So, basically, he got the award for doing the exact opposite of everything Trump works to represent. Sounds about right.</p>
               <p>As for Obama, is it true that he didn&rsquo;t know why he got the award? At the time, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/us/politics/10assess.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> that he didn&rsquo;t see the award &ldquo;as a recognition of my own accomplishments, but rather as an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>Is that what Trump&rsquo;s talking about? It&rsquo;s not surprising that he isn&rsquo;t able to comprehend humility or the desire to share recognititon with others. Those aren&rsquo;t traits or values he&rsquo;s very familiar with.</p>

               <p><em><strong>**Spoilers for </strong></em><strong>Young Justice: Outsiders</strong><em><strong> season 3.**</strong></em></p>
               <p><em>Young Justice</em> has been a beloved series for years. Originally airing on Cartoon Network for two seasons from 2010 to 2013, it was cancelled due to low toy sales and Mattel pulling funding, because, you know, if the boys don&rsquo;t buy the toys, no one wins. Thankfully, after a strong fan campaign and high viewership ratings on Netflix, the series was officially renewed for a third season by Warner Bros. in November 2016.</p>
               <p>It was split into two separate sections/arcs, each consisting of thirteen episodes, and that became <em>Young Justice: Outsiders,&nbsp;</em>which is streaming its final episode right now. In <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/young-justice-outsiders-season-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with <em>Teen Vogue</em></a>, executive producers Greg Weisman and Brandon Vietti talked about a lot of things from season three, including the increased queerness of the series.</p>
               <p>The show airs on DC Universe, and because of that, Weisman and Vietti were able to &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/DCComics/status/888449682438889472?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">skew more adult</a> to keep up with the characters as they age,&rdquo; and also do things Cartoon Network, in those days, wouldn&rsquo;t allow them to do&mdash;namely, have a queer lead. On the show, we have the gender-fluid character of Halo, a gifted individual created as a result of the fusion of a Quraci girl and the spirit of a Motherbox. Halo then chooses the name Violet Harper for themselves.</p>
               <p>In the interview, they explain that while &ldquo;mother box&rdquo; implies femininity that isn&rsquo;t exactly true in Halo&rsquo;s case:</p>
               <p>&ldquo;A Mother Box sounds, like well obviously, must be female, because there are Father Boxes and Mother Boxes, but both those things are loose English translations of alien words for a living computer,&rdquo; Weisman explains. &ldquo;And so from Halo&rsquo;s point of view, she isn&rsquo;t sure that she&rsquo;s either a girl or a boy, though clearly, she&rsquo;s in a cis-gendered female body. And so that also becomes questions she&rsquo;s asking herself, decisions she has yet to make, and that includes who and what she&rsquo;s attracted to sexually as well.&rdquo;</p>
               <p>Harper&rsquo;s human form is that of a Muslim, hijabed woman, and so the character goes through a lot of self-exploration to try to understand who they are now, especially with all these conflicted identities. Vietti says, &ldquo;I would call her the perfect sci-fi teenager. To have this incredibly unique character in Violet, this spirit that wakes up in a dead body now has to deal with hormones and issues of romance and religion and gender. We were really excited to work with a character like that and see how she fits into our world. These are all such important sort of coming of age issues that everybody&mdash;everybody&mdash;deals with.&rdquo;</p>
               <p>It was big news on the interwebs when the scene came out showing Aquaman II, Kaldur, <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/aquaman-officially-queer-young-justice/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kissing his boyfriend</a>, Wyynde. For Weisman and the other writers, this was just solidifying how they&rsquo;d viewed the character from day one.</p>
               <blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was never our intention for him to be exclusively gay. We planned once we got our third season and we were on DC Universe streaming instead of Cartoon Network and had frankly more freedom and more flexibility to write the character the way we wanted to. We planned to illustrate the fact that he was bisexual. So we&rsquo;re not taking away the feelings he had for Tula in season one and two, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that now it&rsquo;s been years since Tula passed away. And in that interim time, he and Wyynde got together. It was great to be able to show that, and I&rsquo;ll admit, I think we both felt we wanted to sort of surprise the audience with it. So we could have said from day one of season three, &ldquo;Oh yeah, he&rsquo;s bi. You&rsquo;ll see it later.&rdquo; But we wanted the surprise factor. People seemed very pleased by that episode and the kiss went over pretty well.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
               <p>It went over swimmingly, and it&rsquo;s great to see that, once they were given the reins to create these nuanced queer characters, they took the opportunity. I especially love that they wanted to respect both sides of his bisexuality. That representation was one of the many reasons I was happy to return to <em>Young Justice</em>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>In Maryland, a 16-year-old girl texted a video of herself engaging in a consensual sex act to her best friends. The highest court in Maryland has decided the girl is a child pornographer. <span></span></p>
               <p>&ldquo;For the first time, the Maryland Court of Appeals said it had to grapple with applying the state&rsquo;s child pornography law to minor teens who consensually engage in sexting,&rdquo; writes Tasneem Nashrulla at <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/teen-sexting-child-pornography-maryland-law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BuzzFeed News</a>:</p>
               <blockquote><p>In a similar case last year, a 14-year-old girl in Minnesota was charged with a felony distribution of child pornography after she sent an explicit Snapchat selfie of herself to a boy she liked. The boy distributed the selfie to other students without the girl's permission.</p>
               <p>"It is nonsensical to suggest that [Jane Doe] is both a victim and the perpetrator of her own abuse," the ACLU said in a statement in 2018 urging the court to dismiss the charge against the Minnesota teen. "Jane created the sext of her own body. She was not an exploited child victim. She was exhibiting normal adolescent behavior in the digital age," the statement said.</p>
               <p>A district judge in Minnesota later dismissed the "absurd" and "unjust" charge against the 14-year-old, saying that the state's child pornography law was targeted at adults who abuse children, and not at teens who sext each other.</p>
               <p>Earlier this year, Maryland&rsquo;s lawmakers failed to pass a bill that would have determined if sexting violated the state&rsquo;s child pornography statute.</p>
               <p>The Maryland Court of Appeals urged lawmakers to consider such legislation again to &ldquo;address this contemporary issue.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

               <span>The year 2019</span> isn&rsquo;t even halfway over
               yet, and it&rsquo;s already the worst year for measles since NBC
               stopped airing episodes of <em>Saved By The Bell</em>. Since
               January 1, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-measles-hacks-the-body-and-harms-its-victims-for-years/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               the rash- and fever-causing virus</a> has sickened 880 people
               across 24 states. That&rsquo;s more than all the cases of the past
               three years <em>combined.</em> The epicenter for this year&rsquo;s
               spike is two outbreaks in New York State&mdash;in Brooklyn and
               Rockland County&mdash;that public health officials have been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-york-vaccine-order-shows-how-health-laws-are-failing-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               struggling to curb</a> since last fall. And the longer the
               virus continues to circulate in these communities, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fighting-measles-la-pulls-a-classic-move-quarantine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               spread to new ones</a>, the more likely it is the US will be
               plunged back into a time when measles hotspots persist as

               constant daily presence</a>.

               &ldquo;Of the more than 3,400 cases of measles reported in the US
               from 2001 to 2019, one third have occurred in the past 18
               months,&rdquo; Adria Lee, a measles epidemiologist with the Centers
               for Disease Control and Prevention, said on a call with
               physicians and reporters Tuesday. She added that 94 percent of
               the cases reported so far in 2019 have been acquired in the US,
               not imported from abroad. &ldquo;The ongoing outbreaks in close-knit
               communities and increased global measles activity is putting
               the US at risk for losing its elimination status.&rdquo;

               <p>
               If you recall your epidemiological history, the US declared
               measles eliminated in 2000. Since then, sporadic annual
               outbreaks have stemmed from unvaccinated travelers bringing the
               virus back as a most unwelcome souvenir of their time abroad.
               These flare-ups used to be easily contained by the high walls
               of herd immunity. But growing anti-vaccine sentiment and
               <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-brady-bunch-measles-episode-is-now-a-viral-menace/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               viral misinformation</a> campaigns have left increasingly
               numerous pockets of the country vulnerable, leading to larger
               and longer outbreaks. And all it takes is 12 months of a single
               strain of measles circulating within its national borders for
               the US to lose its hard-won elimination status.

               In case you were wondering how close the nation is to crossing
               that threshold, put September 2019 on your calendar.
               </p>
               <p>
               That&rsquo;s when the longest-circulating measles strain, D8, will
               have been spreading on American soil for a whole year.
               According to the CDC, D8 is the main strain being transmitted
               through the Orthodox Jewish communities in New York State, and
               was originally imported there from a traveler to Israel. It has
               been in the CDC&rsquo;s infectious disease surveillance system since
               September 2018. If it doesn&rsquo;t get stamped out in the next few
               months, the US will become the second country in the Americas
               to return to the dark pre-elimination ages. And while nothing
               material will happen on that day&mdash;no national alert text
               notification or mobilizing of the National Guard or anything
               like that&mdash;it is a symbolic backslide for the US. Losing
               elimination status not only puts the US at risk for other
               infectious diseases, it jeopardizes the country&rsquo;s role as a
               global leader in public health.
               </p>
               <p>
               &ldquo;We showed other countries that if you do what we did, you too
               could get rid of measles,&rdquo; says Walter A. Orenstein, who was
               the director of the United States Immunization Program at the
               CDC from 1988 to 2004. Currently, Orenstein leads Emory
               University&rsquo;s Program on Vaccine Policy and Development, but for
               26 years he was the US vaccine czar, overseeing two
               presidential initiatives, first under Carter, and then Clinton,
               to expand the nation&rsquo;s collective immunity to infectious
               diseases, chief among them, measles. &ldquo;Every World Health
               Organization region now has the goal to eliminate indigenous
               measles transmission. It was in part the success of the US that
               helped in triggering that. We demonstrated it was doable in a
               country as large and populated as the US.&rdquo;
               </p>

               </div>
               <p>
               On March 16, 2000, Orenstein was among the officials that
               convened a panel of 22 experts to discuss the state of measles
               in the US. For nearly four decades, since the invention of the
               first measles vaccine, the national public health agency had
               been striving toward a singular goal&mdash;driving the virus from US
               borders. Through a combination of policies that required
               schoolchildren to get vaccinated and made the highly effective
               shots accessible to the poorest parts of the population, by the
               late &rsquo;90s, measles was sickening only about 100 people per
               year&mdash;less than one case per million Americans. And nearly all
               of the cases were imported. The special commission&rsquo;s job was to
               decide if that was good enough to finally declare measles
               stamped out.
               </p>

               While the group of doctors, epidemiologists, and public health
               experts agreed that the virus appeared to no longer be
               circulating within US borders, they argued over how to label
               the accomplishment. They couldn&rsquo;t really say that measles had
               been eradicated, for practical purposes more than anything.
               With the rest of the world, minus Cuba, still firmly in the
               grips of a measles contagion that killed a quarter of a million
               people every year, it would have been close to impossible to
               ensure that travelers and immigrants wouldn&rsquo;t bring at least a
               few cases across US borders now and then. They could call it
               &ldquo;eliminated,&rdquo; but many worried that this would be confusing for
               the general public, and could even instill a false sense of
               security, potentially unraveling a decades-long vaccination
               campaign. But in the end, elimination stuck, because people
               like Orenstein thought it would be useful for the rest of the
               world to have a measuring stick, a milestone on the way to
               total eradication. The definition they agreed upon was the
               absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for greater
               than 12 months in the presence of a well-performing
               surveillance system.

               <p>
               The Americas&mdash;an area encompassing 35 countries and 12
               territories&mdash;reached this goal just a few years later. But it
               wasn&rsquo;t until 2016 that the WHO declared it the first of six
               global regions to eliminate measles. The other five committed
               to accomplishing the same goal by 2020. Now the chances of that
               happening are looking increasingly grim. In the first four
               months of 2019, 179 countries reported 168,193 cases of
               measles, an increase of 117,000 over 2018, according to the
               WHO. The biggest spikes have hit Madagascar, Ukraine, and the
               Philippines, where thousands of children have died. These
               upticks aren&rsquo;t happening in a vacuum&mdash;the Philippines, Ukraine,
               and Israel account for the majority of cases imported into the
               US.
               </p>
               <p>
               The reasons for these recent failures vary from political
               instability to economic turmoil to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meet-the-pro-vaxxers-helping-to-stave-off-the-next-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               vaccine hesitancy</a>, which the WHO cited as one of the top 10
               threats to global health in 2019. And in an increasingly
               connected world, elimination status is fragile, as the US is
               finding out. It&rsquo;s a lesson its neighbor to the south,
               Venezuela, has also learned recently. Racked by a collapsing
               economy and crumbling health system, vaccination rates sank to
               a dismal 52 percent in 2018. An ensuing measles epidemic
               sickened 7,809 and killed 74. It lost its elimination status in
               June of last year and has yet to claw it back.
               </p>
               <p>
               If the US does lose its elimination status, it won&rsquo;t be due to
               economic chaos or a lack of public health resources; it will be
               because viral misinformation <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-anti-vaccine-crack-down/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               proved harder to contain</a> than the virus itself. Orenstein
               thinks the time has come for a new presidential initiative
               designed to combat not structural barriers to vaccination, but
               philosophical ones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad and frustrated to see people
               suffering unnecessarily because they just don&rsquo;t understand the
               facts,&rdquo; he says. With better behavioral research, maybe it will
               be possible to find messaging that works. Because the need to
               combat vaccine hesitancy is bigger than just the current
               outbreaks.
               </p>
               <p>
               &ldquo;Measles, because it&rsquo;s so contagious, is an indicator disease,&rdquo;
               says Orenstein. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s often the first one you see, but it means
               that other vaccine-preventable diseases are also on the rise.&rdquo;
               Measles might be making headlines today, but tomorrow the story
               could be about something much worse.

               <p>
               <span>On Friday, the</span> legislature of
               Missouri <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/politics/missouri-abortion-bill-house/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed</a> a ban on abortions, among the most
               extreme of any state. It prohibits any abortions after eight
               weeks of gestation, putting it among the category of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/heartbeat-bills-get-the-science-of-fetal-heartbeats-all-wrong/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               misleadingly named &ldquo;heartbeat bills&rdquo;</a> that use fetal cardiac
               activity as a marker for &hellip; well, illegality, really. Like a law
               signed earlier last week in Alabama, the Missouri bill contains
               no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. That makes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/abortion-laws-states.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eight US states</a> with similar extreme bans
               on their books&mdash;each vying to be the law that makes its way to
               the Supreme Court and overturns <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, the 1973
               decision that made abortion legal in the United States.
               </p>
               <p>
               None of the restrictions have gone into effect, either because
               of delays built into the legislation itself or legal
               challenges. If they do, they&rsquo;ll spark an unintentional, vast
               experiment in public health. Already, states with the most
               restrictions on access to abortions are also those with the
               highest rates of maternal and infant mortality. The connection
               isn&rsquo;t direct&mdash;abortion access can be a kind of proxy for access
               to all sorts of pre- and postnatal health care, not to mention
               correlating roughly with better-funded education systems, lower
               poverty rates, and tighter environmental regulation. But
               evidence from history does suggest a hypothesis: More women and
               babies are going to get sick, be poor, and die.
               </p>

               <p>
               In the mid 2000s, billboards worrying about the mental health
               of women who&rsquo;d gotten abortions were common, and justices on
               the Supreme Court <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/550/124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed concern</a> that those women might
               experience psychologically damaging &ldquo;regret.&rdquo; Diana Greene
               Foster, a demographer at UC San Francisco, started wondering if
               any of that was true. Until then, most research looking at
               abortion outcomes compared women who&rsquo;d gotten one to women
               who&rsquo;d gotten pregnant and had a baby. That&rsquo;s science&mdash;isolate
               the thing you want to study by looking at people who have it
               and people who don&rsquo;t.
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               It&rsquo;s not great science, though, because, as Foster realized,
               the control group wasn&rsquo;t actually controlling. It didn&rsquo;t
               isolate the variable. What you really need to do is to look at
               women with unwanted pregnancies who sought an abortion, and
               compare those who got one with those who did not. &ldquo;If you make
               abortion restrictions, who they&rsquo;ll affect are people who want
               abortions and get births, so it was important to get the
               science right,&rdquo; Foster says. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the effect if women are
               able to get the abortion they want? Or can&rsquo;t get the abortion
               they want?&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               Foster and her colleagues painstakingly set up a new
               experiment. Between 2008 and 2010 they used abortion clinic
               visits to recruit women in three groups: 273 women who got a
               first-trimester abortion, 452 who got an abortion at up to two
               weeks under the clinic&rsquo;s &ldquo;gestational limit,&rdquo; and 231 whose
               pregnancies were up to three weeks <em>over</em> the clinic&rsquo;s
               gestational limit and were therefore denied an abortion. In
               other words: got, barely got, didn&rsquo;t get.
               </p>
               <p>
               (Half of these women, it&rsquo;s worth noting, had incomes below the
               federal poverty line. Three-quarters said they didn&rsquo;t have
               enough money for food, housing, and transportation. More than
               half already had kids.)
               </p>
               <p>
               Then Foster&rsquo;s team spent the next five years following up with
               the women by phone to see what happened. It was called the
               Turnaway Study, and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2592320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first thing it found</a> was that mental
               health concerns for women who wanted abortions and got them
               were unfounded. &ldquo;We found no differences in mental health over
               time, with the exception that people who are denied were worse
               off in terms of self-esteem,&rdquo; Foster says. (Even that effect
               was short-lived, spiking at one week after the denial; the
               groups&rsquo; self-esteem was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/S11136-014-0687-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the same</a> six months later.)
               </p>
               <p>
               The Turnaway Study did find differences, though. Women in the
               turnaway group were <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely to be poor</a> six months after
               their clinic visit&mdash;and still poor four years later. Of the
               turnaways, those who had more children <em>after</em> the one
               they were turned away for had <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2698454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worse maternal bonding</a> with that initial
               child. If a turnaway woman already had children&mdash;as 61 percent
               did&mdash;those children <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347618312976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scored lower</a> on standard measures of
               development, and again were more likely to live below the
               federal poverty line in the years that followed. And poverty,
               to be clear, is a prime risk factor for health problems and for
               diminished access to good health care. &ldquo;Half of these women
               said, the reason I want an abortion is that I can&rsquo;t afford to
               have a kid,&rdquo; Foster says. &ldquo;This study doesn&rsquo;t say that poor
               women should get abortions. It says women who want abortions
               should get abortions.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <div>
               
               </div>
               <p>
               Nor does the Turnaway Study say that being a mother makes women
               poor. Not by itself, anyway. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a major predictor of poverty
               in our country, not because of its prevalence but because we
               penalize every aspect of it,&rdquo; Foster says. &ldquo;The supports we
               have for low-income women are not sufficient to keep them from
               falling into poverty.&rdquo; She says that something like 4,000 women
               get turned away from clinics every year because of gestation
               time limits&mdash;exactly what are getting more restrictive under the
               six-week bans. If those laws go into effect, that number will
               likely go up.
               </p>
               <p>
               It&rsquo;s true, though, that poverty is only a proxy for health
               outcomes. Foster&rsquo;s team has a paper in review on actual,
               longer-term health consequences among the turnaways, but it&rsquo;s
               not out yet, and I didn&rsquo;t find any research comparing outcomes
               in states with different abortion access levels beyond when
               women get abortions during a pregnancy&mdash;second-trimester
               abortions <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2019/04000/Change_in_Second_Trimester_Abortion_After.25.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">become more common</a>&mdash;and the admittedly blunt
               statistical instruments of maternal and infant mortality.

               <p>
               Fortunately&mdash;well, maybe not &ldquo;fortunately,&rdquo; but you get what I
               mean&mdash;other countries have already run this experiment.

               Take <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.82.10.1328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romania</a>. Abortion was legal there until
               1966, when Nicolae Ceausescu became president and outlawed it,
               along with contraception. He said he wanted to increase the
               number of native-born Romanians. Women were forced to get
               pelvic inspections at work. Police informers roamed maternity
               hospitals. Performing abortions was a crime.

               As a result, the birth rate in Romania went up for a couple
               years, and then in 1970 it went into freefall. Deaths from
               complications resulting from attempted, illegal abortions
               increased to 10 times that of the rest of Europe&mdash;about 500
               women a year, more than 10,000 women over two decades. The
               maternal mortality rate spiked to 150 women per 100,000 births.
               That number is insanely high. Today, when the US has <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the worst maternal mortality</a> in the
               industrialized world, it&rsquo;s only <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(16)31470-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sixth of that</a> (except in Louisiana, where
               the maternal mortality rate for women over 35 years of age is a
               1980s-Romania-adjacent 145.9 per 100,000 births). Also, nearly
               200,000 children were <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/16/what-actually-happens-when-a-country-bans-abortion-romania-alabama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put in hellish orphanages</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
               In December of 1989 a revolution cleared out Ceausescu&rsquo;s
               government. The new leadership instituted an emergency public
               health measure to legalize abortion and contraception. The
               maternal mortality rate fell 50 percent in the first year.
               </p>
               <p>
               Is this bumming you out? Here&rsquo;s the converse. Amid worries
               about maternal mortality, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nepal legalized abortion</a> in 2002. Over the
               next decade or so, 1,200 clinicians learned to provide
               abortions, and 500,000 women got them. The maternal mortality
               rate dropped from 360 to 170 per 100,000 live births, and while
               the number of abortion complications went up&mdash;along with total
               hospital admissions and total live births&mdash;the number of serious
               complications went down.

               While pregnancy, in general, is something like <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2012/02000/The_Comparative_Safety_of_Legal_Induced_Abortion.3.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14 times as risky</a> as a legal abortion, much
               of the danger in the past came from <em>illegal</em>
               abortions&mdash;often performed without a trained clinician,
               sometimes with dangerous methods that involve inserting objects
               into a woman&rsquo;s uterus. When people talk about &ldquo;back-alley&rdquo;
               abortions and deaths from coat hangers in the United States,
               <a href="http://unmfamilyplanning.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/82694194/Ch%203%20-%20Unintended%20Pregnancy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that&rsquo;s what they mean</a>. Before legalization,
               hundreds of women died every year in the US from botched
               induced abortions (as opposed to &ldquo;spontaneous abortions,&rdquo; the
               technical term for a miscarriage). Legalization also resulted
               in fewer low-weight births and pre-term births.
               </p>
               <p>
               But there&rsquo;s reason for hope here, in a backwards sort of way.
               If abortions become illegal again, the drugs mifepristone and
               misoprostol could combat the more dangerous surgical
               improvisations. Today in the US, both drugs are used, often in
               combination, to induce an abortion. It&rsquo;s called, weirdly, a
               &ldquo;medical&rdquo; abortion (because of the medicine, not because it
               needs a doctor) as distinct from a &ldquo;surgical&rdquo; abortion, even
               though that generally uses suction&mdash;<a href="https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book-excerpts/health-article/early-abortion-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aspiration</a>&mdash;not a scalpel. By law,
               pharmacies can fill prescriptions for misoprostol; only
               abortion providers, clinicians, can provide mifepristone.
               </p>

               </div>
               <p>
               The <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/2000/09/early-medical-abortion-regimens-using-different-dosages-mifepristone-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard dosages</a> to induce an abortion&mdash;up
               to 10 weeks of gestation&mdash;are 200 milligrams of mifepristone and
               800 micrograms of misoprostol, though lower doses of the
               latter, down to 400 mcg, can also work. Taking those
               medications at those doses will induce an abortion. An
               organization called <a href="https://plancpills.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plan C</a> has a lot more information about that.

               So in Romania, for example, &ldquo;abortion mortality skyrocketed
               because people were doing illegal things, and eventually people
               figured out how to do safer illegal things,&rdquo; Foster says. &ldquo;When
               it&rsquo;s illegal, it can be extremely unsafe, but I&rsquo;m hoping that
               doesn&rsquo;t happen in the United States. I&rsquo;m hoping pills online or
               something will meet the needs.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               As any recreational drug user on the Dark Web (or man too
               embarrassed to ask a doctor for boner pills) knows, online
               sellers offer the same medications otherwise only available by
               prescription. That can seem like a scary prospect&mdash;are they
               reliable, are the pills real, will they just steal the money?
               But when one team of researchers tried to get abortion
               medications online, <a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(17)30475-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they found</a> it actually worked. The
               misoprostol was often lower-concentration than FDA-approved
               pills in the US, and some of the packages were damaged, but
               what they got from 16 different online pharmacies tested as
               chemically the same, and was usually cheaper than going to a
               clinic.
               </p>
               <p>
               Online pills might make this next chapter of abortion history
               better than the last. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a crazy idea. It&rsquo;s not
               necessarily an unsafe thing to do,&rdquo; says Elizabeth Raymond, an
               ob-gyn and researcher at Gynuity Health Products who led the
               online-buying study. &ldquo;Part of what&rsquo;s problematic about the
               situation is, it&rsquo;s not clearly legal &hellip; If a woman orders these
               pills from overseas, it&rsquo;s not clear what the legality of that
               is.&rdquo; Raymond&rsquo;s also doing <a href="https://telabortion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a study now</a> to see how telemedicine and
               prescriptions for those drugs could help supplant the dwindling
               number of clinics in the US.
               </p>
               <p>
               If six-week bans go into effect, if <em>Roe</em> gets
               overturned, some states will make abortion mostly illegal or
               illegal altogether, while others <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2019/01/22/abortion-laws-new-york-how-they-change-immediately/2643065002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try to ensure</a> continued legality. The
               public health experiment will commence, with the two
               populations every experiment needs. Some women will have access
               to safe abortions; others will not. Gets, doesn&rsquo;t get. Control
               group and experimental. And as with all cutting-edge science,
               no one really knows how this experiment is going to turn out.

      <![CDATA[<div>
               <p>
               A decade ago, <a href="http://rss.stevesaus.me/wired.com/tag/amazon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon</a>
               abruptly deleted copies of George Orwell's <em>1984</em> from
               the <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-kindle/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kindles</a> of its
               American customers. The move instantly evoked the &ldquo;memory
               holes&rdquo; in the novel's totalitarian dystopia, and it inspired
               about equal measures of shock, outrage, and jokes. (If a
               fictional Amazon in a dystopian novel had performed the same
               mass deletion, critics would have said it was too on the nose.)
               But in hindsight, Amazon's action was also a striking harbinger
               of a shift that has only become more pronounced since then: our
               wholesale tilt toward becoming a tenant society.

               In that particular case, Amazon said the books had been added
               to the Kindle Store by a vendor who didn't actually have the
               rights to them. &ldquo;When we were notified of this by the rights
               holder, we removed the illegal copies from our systems and from
               customers' devices, and refunded customers,&rdquo; said a
               spokesperson at the time. Amazon quickly apologized and said
               that in the future it would leave books on people's devices
               even if there was an error in how they got there. But one thing
               the company couldn't take back was the demonstration of its
               sheer power. Even the biggest traditional retailer could hardly
               dream of reaching into people's houses and taking back what it
               had sold them.

               Today, we may think we own things because we paid for them and
               brought them home, but as long as they run software or have
               digital connectivity, the sellers continue to have control over
               the product. We are renters of our own objects, there by the
               grace of the true owner.

               Of course, &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/iot/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">connected machines</a> do come
               with plenty of upsides. A modern washing machine doesn't just
               agitate the clothes around for a fixed amount of time; it
               senses water levels and dampness and can adjust how long it
               spins so your clothes come out at just the right level of
               dryness. Cars are more fuel-efficient because their computers
               optimize many aspects of their operation, from fuel injection
               to braking. All of this is good for the environment and your
               wallet.

               But that is not all that's happening. Connectivity and embedded

               their profits and to exercise as much control as they can

               <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/john-deere-farmers-right-to-repair/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               John Deere tractors</a>&mdash;those iconic, bright green giants that
               rumble across big fields, noisily harvesting wheat, corn, and
               soy. For generations, farmers have repaired their tractors
               right on the farmstead. But in its push toward building ever
               more automated, sensor-packed agricultural equipment, John
               Deere has put draconian <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">software
               locks</a> on its tractors, forcing customers to visit the
               company's own repair shops. Farmers complain they are charged
               exorbitant sums for even simple repairs. And they lose crucial
               time heading out to the shop during the harvest season.
               Desperate farmers have taken to hanging out in shady internet
               forums, looking for software that will get around John Deere's
               locks, trying to assert their right to repair the tractors they
               ostensibly own.

               <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/apple" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple</a>, too, has
               waged a scorched-earth campaign against anyone with the
               audacity to repair its products or replace its batteries. In
               2017 it came to light that the company was secretly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-battery-slow-down/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">throttling
               iPhones</a> with older batteries, slowing down their
               performance. Apple said it was doing so only to keep the aging
               phones from crashing outright. This technical reason for the
               move made sense; the fact that it was secret did not. And it
               was hard to ignore the ways the policy might also benefit the
               company. Users with increasingly slow phones were, in effect,
               being nudged to purchase a new device, allowing Apple to
               increase its already hefty profit margins.
               </p>
               <p>
               After the scandal, an embarrassed Apple offered cheap
               replacement batteries. It soon became clear why the company
               held the line against them for so long. New iPhone sales went
               down; Tim Cook told shareholders that increased repairs were &ldquo;a
               factor&rdquo; in this trend.

               More recently, Apple has reportedly cut a deal with Amazon to
               remove &ldquo;unauthorized&rdquo; refurbishers of Apple products&mdash;people who
               resell <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-buy-a-used-phone/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">repaired
               machines</a>&mdash;from the Amazon marketplace. In return, it will
               let Amazon sell new Apple products: a win-win for the two
               giants, but not for consumers. Apple also forces recyclers to
               shred old iPhones and Macbooks rather than reuse their parts
               and materials. That's definitely bad not just for consumers but
               also for the environment.

               But this isn't merely a fight over prices and profit margins.
               What happens when you do something with your car, phone, or
               other object that corporate headquarters really doesn't like?
               Our connected devices can simply be bricked on command. Cars
               have been immobilized, for example, when the ostensible owner
               fell behind on payments by as little as three days. John Deere
               tractors with &ldquo;unauthorized repairs&rdquo; have been similarly taken
               out of commission. How long before other devices start behaving
               as spies and taskmasters in our own home? Will the coffee maker
               let us have that seventh cup that the doctor advised us
               against?
               </p>
               <p>
               It's true that repairs of complicated gadgets may sometimes
               need to be done by licensed parties. But rather than more
               secrecy and exclusive control, companies could expand the base
               of people capable of doing the work. It's also true that
               connectivity is necessary for devices that run software; bugs
               need to be fixed and software updated. But there is no reason
               for that to be an unbounded license to brick a device or erase
               its content.
               </p>
               <p>
               In March, US senator and Democratic presidential candidate
               Elizabeth Warren called for Congress to pass a national
               <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/right-to-repair-elizabeth-warren-farmers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               right-to-repair law</a> that &ldquo;empowers farmers to repair their
               equipment without going to an authorized agent.&rdquo; But it's not
               just farmers. It's all of us. We have fewer rights as digital
               tenants than we do as tenants of real estate, where eviction is
               subject to due process. If we purchase something, it is ours.
               We shouldn't let ownership go down the memory hole.

               typing a paper in Google Docs count? What about using a mapping

               screen-based media in all its forms, instead of just lumping
               everything together like they used to. Some types of screen
               fare are like sugar: Limit consumption, especially before
               bedtime, and watch for signs of overindulgence&mdash;obesity,
               aggression, grade slippage. Others are more like proteins and

               <span>With each new</span> episode of <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/game-of-thrones/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Game of
               Thrones</em></a>, complaints about the hurried and inconsistent
               writing seem to mount. Long-standing threats are being
               dispatched too easily, and plot threads we thought would matter
               have been quietly dropped. More troubling still, character
               motivations appear to be in a state of flux, and much of the
               drama involves clever people committing obvious blunders and
               suffering reversals of fortune as a result. Some fans are so
               frustrated that they've launched a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org petition</a> asking for the final
               season to be remade by "competent writers," which is not how
               these things generally work. And honestly, it's not as simple
               as good writing versus bad. No season that knights Brienne can
               be entirely bad. The problem is that the writing has changed,
               and it's changed in a way that breaks important rules the show
               had previously set for itself. I think I know why.

               <p>
               It all comes down to how stories are crafted, and for that, we
               need to start with two different types of writers: plotters and
               pantsers. Plotters create a detailed outline before they commit
               a word to the page. Pantsers prefer to discover the story as
               they write it&mdash;flying by the seat of their pants, so to speak.
               Both approaches have their advantages. Since plotters know the
               story in advance, it's easier to create tight narratives with
               satisfying conclusions. But that amount of predestination can
               sometimes make characters feel like cogs in service of the
               story. Pantsers have an easier time writing characters that
               live and breathe. They generate the plot by dropping a person
               with desires and needs into a dramatic situation and
               documenting the results. But with the characters in charge,
               pantsers risk a meandering or poorly paced structure, and they
               can struggle to tie everything together.
               </p>
               <p>
               To be clear, the advantages of each are not guarantees. And
               plotters can write memorable characters, while pantsers can
               write thrilling sequences. The differences usually smooth
               themselves out over successive drafts anyway. Where the effect
               can be pronounced is in an ongoing television or book series,
               since the beginning of the story gets released and digested by
               the public while the rest is still being written.
               </p>
               <p>
               George R.R. Martin <a href="https://wikiofthrones.com/7228/george-r-r-martin-explains-hes-gardener-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">describes</a> this distinction in terms of
               architects and gardeners. He's firmly among the latter. He
               plants character seeds and carefully guides their growth, and
               when the show was directly adapting his <em>A Song of Ice and
               Fire</em> series, the approach paid off. It's why every
               emotional beat and fair-in-hindsight surprise landed with such
               devastating weight: The terrible things that happened to these
               characters happened because of earlier choices they'd made.
               Those ever-blooming stories were a boon to the showrunners, who
               had their pick, but they're also the reason the narrative
               momentum of the books slowed over time.

               After the first major plot arc resolved in the third book,
               <em>A Storm of Swords</em> (seasons 3 and 4), Martin <a href="https://observationdeck.kinja.com/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-unedited-interview-886117845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planned</a> to skip the story ahead five years.
               But he couldn't make the gap in action feel true to the
               characters or the world, so he eventually decided to write his
               way through those five years instead. Knowing the bridging
               material wasn't ever going to be as gripping as the central
               conflicts, he compensated by planting more seeds in more
               corners of his already complex world. And once he had them, he
               couldn't prune them back without their resolutions feeling
               abrupt or forced. Worse, some of his idle characters were
               taking the opportunity to grow in the wrong directions, pulling
               away from the ending he had in mind for them. Soon, the garden
               was overgrown, the projected length of the series kept
               expanding, and the books stopped coming.
               </p>
               <p>
               For the next couple seasons, showrunners David Benioff and D.
               B. Weiss tried to take over management of Martin's sprawling
               garden, simplifying and combining character arcs with mixed
               results. Then, with the start of season 7, they shifted their
               focus from telling the unfolding story of an entire world to
               concluding a particular tale set within it. They gave
               themselves a fixed endpoint&mdash;13 episodes to the finale, and no
               more.
               </p>
               <p>
               In so doing, the showrunners moved as far to one end of the
               plotter/pantser continuum as Martin is to the other. They
               weren't trying to resolve every character arc or pay off every
               last bit of world-building. They knew the destination Martin
               had in mind, they understood the dots they had to connect to
               get there, and they wanted to maximize fan entertainment along
               the way. Then, presumably, they asked themselves questions.
               What big set pieces did they want to deliver? What surprises
               could rival the greatest twists of the show? Which of the
               remaining conflicts would yield the best drama, and which
               onscreen pairings would bring the most emotion? What did they
               think we, the audience, wanted to finally see before it was all
               over? It was a <em>Game of Thrones</em> bucket list. And once
               they had that list, they needed to maneuver the characters into
               place.

               That's why <em>Game of Thrones</em> feels different now. A show
               that had been about our inability to escape the past became
               about the spectacle of the present. Characters with incredible
               depth and agency&mdash;all the more rope with which to hang
               themselves&mdash;became whatever the moment needed them to be. They
               took uncharacteristic actions and made uncharacteristically bad
               decisions so the required events could unfold with the
               appropriate stakes. Characters were spared the deaths they'd
               sown so they'd be available for later scenes. Organic
               consequences gave way to contrivance. Gone was the conflict
               between complicated people with incompatible goals. Grey
               morality turned black and white. Characters rushed through
               their foreshadowed arcs for the thinnest of reasons, or in some
               cases reversed their arcs entirely. The characters just weren't
               in charge anymore. The ending was.
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>

               </div>
               <p>
               No one's to blame. Really. Keeping a million plates spinning
               the way Martin did is hard, and if you're the showrunners,
               setting those plates down without breaking too many is hard
               too. Writing is hard. Especially when literally everyone's
               watching.
               </p>
               <p>
               Still, the approach to storytelling changed in the third act,
               and an audience can feel that happening. We fell in love with
               one kind of show, but that's not the show that's ending. No
               amount of spectacle or fan service is satisfying if we don't
               buy how the characters got there. Treating the journey as
               equally important to the destination is how you get conclusions
               that feel earned, and it's how characters stay alive after
               they've met their fates.
               </p>
               <p>
               Endings invite us to consider the story as a whole; where it
               started, where it went, and where it left us. And we can feel
               the gaps as this one comes to a close.

      <![CDATA[<div>
               <p>
               <span>When I first</span> read that Facebook has
               an employee whose title is &ldquo;global head of counterterrorism
               policy,&rdquo; I was surprised. I had always thought of
               counterterrorism policies as things that governments, not
               companies, had.
               </p>
               <p>
               But it turns out this distinction isn&rsquo;t always as meaningful as
               I&rsquo;d thought. One job of Facebook&rsquo;s global head of
               counterterrorism policy&mdash;a national security expert named Brian
               Fishman&mdash;is to do what the US government wants done. This
               subservience would raise questions even if we didn&rsquo;t have a
               president with a famously reckless foreign policy. But we do,
               and so far Facebook seems willing to abet it.
               </p>
               <p>
               Consider President Trump&rsquo;s deeply hostile policy toward Iran.
               Ostensibly its goal is to change Iran&rsquo;s behavior, but both
               National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State
               Mike Pompeo have advocated changing its regime. And there is
               <a href="https://lobelog.com/the-path-to-war-with-iran-is-paved-with-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concern</a> among longtime Bolton watchers that
               this aspiration will lead to war.

               Trump&rsquo;s Iran policy consists of imposing <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48119109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy-crushing</a> sanctions, coercing other nations
               into joining in them, and doing various other <a href="https://lobelog.com/boltons-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antagonistic
               things</a>. One such thing came last month when the Trump
               administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-designation-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-foreign-terrorist-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a> Iran&rsquo;s Revolutionary Guard a
               terrorist organization. This was the first time in history that
               the US had slapped the terrorist label on a foreign
               government&rsquo;s military&mdash;or for that matter on any part of a
               foreign government.
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               This development <a href="https://lobelog.com/irgc-designation-more-from-the-war-with-iran-playbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alarmed</a> some foreign policy observers, but
               it didn&rsquo;t give Facebook pause. The day after Trump&rsquo;s move,
               Instagram, a Facebook property, <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/instant-ban-for-iran-s-irgc-on-instagram-social-media-giant-blocks-commanders-sites/29886908.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocked</a> the accounts of high-ranking
               Revolutionary Guard officers. And the next week <em>The New
               York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/technology/terrorist-groups-social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Fishman had said Facebook
               would have zero tolerance for any group the US deems a
               terrorist organization.
               </p>
               <p>
               So basically Trump can tell Facebook to de-platform any part of
               any foreign government&mdash;including, presumably, an entire foreign
               government&mdash;and Fishman, along with Facebook CEO Mark
               Zuckerberg, will reply with a crisp salute? Under Facebook&rsquo;s
               current policy, that would seem to be the case.
               </p>
               <p>
               When I asked Fishman to justify this policy, he said it&rsquo;s
               designed to keep Facebook on the right side of the law, which
               prohibits Americans from providing &ldquo;material support&rdquo; to any
               group deemed a &ldquo;Foreign Terrorist Organization.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               But, I replied, the law goes on to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2339A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spell out the things</a> that would constitute
               &ldquo;material support,&rdquo; and none of them sound much like &ldquo;letting
               these groups post on your social media platform.&rdquo; Fishman said,
               &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a lawyer. I&rsquo;m a policy guy.&rdquo; And apparently Facebook&rsquo;s
               lawyers have advised the company to err on the side of caution.
               (By the way, in addition to respecting the government&rsquo;s
               terrorist designations, Facebook has its own definition of a
               terrorist group, so the list of groups it bans goes beyond the
               government&rsquo;s list of terrorist groups.)

               Of course, one way to get clarity on the law would be to not
               de-platform Iran&rsquo;s Revolutionary Guard, see if Trump&rsquo;s Justice
               Department tried to prosecute you, and be prepared to take the
               matter to court. But Fishman said Facebook has &ldquo;no plans&rdquo; to
               seek clarity via the courts.
               </p>
               <p>
               It may seem amazing that Trump has the power to declare, in
               effect, that none of the 125,000 members of Iran&rsquo;s
               Revolutionary Guard can have accounts on Facebook or Instagram.
               But that&rsquo;s nothing. The Trump administration is said to be
               <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48111594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preparing</a> to put the terrorist label on the
               Muslim Brotherhood, a social services and political activism
               network that has way more members than that in more than a
               dozen countries.

               The heart of the Muslim Brotherhood is in Egypt. In fact,
               Trump&rsquo;s push to deem the group terrorist came after Egypt&rsquo;s
               president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, encouraged it during a White
               House visit last month. So, are members of the Egyptian Muslim
               Brotherhood indeed, as the terrorist label would suggest,
               associated with the killing of innocent civilians?
               </p>
               <p>
               Well, in the sense of being the innocent civilians who get
               killed. A few years ago President Sisi&rsquo;s troops gunned down
               hundreds of them while they were peacefully demonstrating. What
               they were protesting was the fact that he had deposed Egypt&rsquo;s
               democratically elected president (a Muslim Brotherhood member)
               in a coup.

               David Kirkpatrick of <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/middleeast/is-the-muslim-brotherhood-terrorist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> last week that &ldquo;even experts critical
               of the Brotherhood agree that the organization does not meet
               the criteria for a terrorist group,&rdquo; and Shadi Hamid of the
               Brookings Institution has <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2017/04/11/is-the-muslim-brotherhood-a-terrorist-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written</a> that &ldquo;there is not a single
               American expert on the Muslim Brotherhood who supports
               designating them as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               When I asked Fishman about the Muslim Brotherhood, his answer
               gave me a bit of hope. He said that, if Trump deems the group a
               terrorist organization, Facebook will &ldquo;assess [our policy] very
               carefully&rdquo;&mdash;though he sounded more concerned about the
               practicality of enforcement than about the wisdom or legitimacy
               of it; he said the Brotherhood is so sprawling and amorphous as
               to make it &ldquo;hard to understand even where the edges are.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t single out Facebook for criticism. Other
               social media platforms do things that align uncannily with
               Trump&rsquo;s foreign policy. Last month Google <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/04/23/google-blocks-iranian-state-tvs-youtube-and-gmail-after-anti-israel-propaganda/#2e6fa0d977bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocked</a> two Iranian government
               broadcasters&rsquo; access to YouTube. And last year, the security
               firm FireEye (whose early investors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireEye" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">included</a> the CIA) <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/suspected-iranian-influence-operation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identified</a> &ldquo;a suspected influence operation
               that appears to originate from Iran&rdquo; and promotes &ldquo;political
               narratives in line with Iranian interests&rdquo;&mdash;and within hours of
               this announcement, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube had <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/08/21/facebook-google-and-twitter-dismantle-global-iranian-propaganda-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suspended</a> all accounts associated with the
               operation.

               I don&rsquo;t doubt that Iran&rsquo;s state media, and other pro-Iran
               outlets that have been blocked by American social media
               companies, have said untrue or offensive things. But what are
               the chances that they say untrue or offensive things at a
               <a href="http://projects.thestar.com/donald-trump-fact-check/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher rate than President Trump</a>? Yet I&rsquo;m
               pretty sure Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey didn&rsquo;t spend his recent
               <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-has-closed-door-meeting-with-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sit-down</a> with Trump threatening to
               de-platform him.
               </p>
               <p>
               When major social media platforms mute the expression of the
               Iranian government&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s that much easier for the
               White House&rsquo;s relentless anti-Iran rhetorical campaign to carry
               the day, and that much easier to sell regime change to America
               and to the world. And if the Iraq War taught us anything, it&rsquo;s
               that turning down the volume on claims made by an adversary and
               its supporters&mdash;claims such as, &ldquo;really, we don&rsquo;t have weapons
               of mass destruction, which is why international inspectors
               haven&rsquo;t found any!&rdquo;&mdash;can come at a high cost.
               </p>

               <p>
               Eerily, we now&mdash;as during the run-up to the Iraq War&mdash;have an
               administration saying misleading things about an adversary.
               John Bolton <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1095060986787258368?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> this year that &ldquo;Iran continues to seek
               nuclear weapons.&rdquo; There is zero evidence for this claim, and
               there is considerable evidence against it. Because Iran has
               continued to comply with the nuclear deal that Trump abandoned,
               its nuclear energy processing plants are subject to an
               extremely strict monitoring and inspections regime; there&rsquo;s
               basically no way these plants could be producing weapons-grade
               material without us knowing it.
               </p>
               <p>
               This isn&rsquo;t the first time there&rsquo;s been cause to doubt Bolton&rsquo;s
               ability to assess evidence. In 2002 he said, &ldquo;We are confident
               that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction and
               production facilities in Iraq.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               There have always been times, certainly including the run-up to
               wars, when national media companies, for better or worse, did
               the bidding of the American government. (Google &ldquo;Judith Miller,
               New York Times, Iraq War.&rdquo;) But Facebook, Twitter, and Google,
               though American companies, aren&rsquo;t national. Their content is
               published internationally and originates internationally; they
               are global discourse platforms. If the Iraq War fiasco is any
               guide, it would be in America&rsquo;s interest for them to start
               acting like it.

               But the Facebook-owned image-sharing network won&rsquo;t remove the
               misleading posts; nor will it demote them in users&rsquo; main feeds,
               leaving millions of people vulnerable to misinformation.
               </p>
               <p>
               Since 2016, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/facebook/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a> has referred
               questionable posts to a team of over 50 news organizations from
               around the globe. Any item determined to be false is labeled
               and demoted in News Feed; anyone who tries to share a false
               post is warned against doing so. The same fact-checkers will
               review Instagram posts, but those found to be false will not be
               labeled as such, nor will they be demoted in users&rsquo; feeds or in
               the Instagram Stories carousel.
               </p>
               <p>
               An Instagram spokesperson said the company is focused on making
               it harder for new users to be algorithmically exposed to
               misinformation, rather than stemming the reach of
               misinformation. The spokesperson said Facebook&rsquo;s and
               Instagram&rsquo;s approaches to misleading posts differ in part
               because Instagram lacks a re-share button and the content users
               see in their Instagram feeds comes solely from accounts they
               have chosen to follow, unlike on Facebook.

               Instagram is a hotbed for disinformation and inflammatory
               content designed to exacerbate tensions among different
               demographic groups. In 2017, the platform was the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-instagram-became-russian-iras-social-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               go-to social network for the Russian propaganda</a> arm known
               as the Internet Research Agency, which used more than 130 fake
               Instagram accounts to spread polluted information and reinforce
               cultural divisions among Americans. The top 10 IRA accounts
               collectively garnered more than 120 million engagements on
               Instagram and had hundreds of thousands of followers, according
               to a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-instagram-became-russian-iras-social-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               report</a> commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

               Instagram has also proved to be an effective and popular tool
               among extremists and conspiracy theorists. After Facebook,
               YouTube, and others banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and
               his media organization Infowars last August, Jones and Infowars
               took to Instagram, and used the site to cultivate a massive
               audience until they were finally banned from the
               platform&mdash;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-bans-alex-jones-extremists/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">along
               with several other extremists</a>&mdash;last week.
               </p>
               <p>
               Extremist accounts and other fake-news mongers certainly owe
               some of their popularity to the algorithms of Instagram&rsquo;s
               recommendation pages like the Explore tab or hashtags. But
               their massive followings also come from word-of-mouth and
               channels like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. Crimping their
               ability to easily reach new audiences doesn&rsquo;t diminish their
               influence on those already trapped in these
               misinformation-ridden ecosystems.
               </p>
               <p>
               Instagram uses image-recognition technology to proactively
               identify posts that could potentially contain misinformation. A
               spokesperson says the company looks for signals like heavy use
               of text overlay on images, or the use of certain words in the
               comments of images to help discern what may warrant a
               fact-check. Additionally, when a particular post or image on
               Facebook is identified as misinformation by the company&rsquo;s
               fact-checkers, Instagram uses image-recognition technology to
               identify similar posts on Instagram and reduce their reach
               through the Explore feed and other recommendation areas, says
               the spokesperson.

               An example of debunked misinformation first found on
               Facebook that was also found on Instagram, according to
               Instagram. The company did not remove the misinformation or
               flag it as such, but instead merely pulled it from the
               Explore page and other public recommendation feeds.

               For now, Instagram says the company&rsquo;s fact-checking partners
               are only receiving a limited number of posts to review, though
               their decisions affect the type of content surfaced to all
               Instagram users. The total will remain limited in coming weeks
               as the company monitors the effectiveness of the fact-checking
               program.
               </p>
               <p>
               Accounts whose posts are repeatedly flagged as misinformation
               won&rsquo;t be penalized beyond the reduced reach through Explore and
               other recommendation sites. The spokesperson says that
               Instagram is &ldquo;looking at&rdquo; potentially creating a system akin to
               Facebook&rsquo;s which would allow posts that have been debunked by
               fact-checkers to include a label denoting that fact, but did
               not offer any timeline for a decision on such a move.
               </p>
               <p>
               When asked why it took so long for the company to develop any
               sort of program dedicated to slowing the spread of
               misinformation, the spokesperson pointed to the peculiarities
               of Instagram as a platform&mdash;including the fact that most images
               posted there are cropped, filtered, or have text added to
               them&mdash;which they said made it more difficult to detect certain
               types of problematic content using automation and
               image-recognition technology.
               </p>
               <p>
               Instagram is working on a new tool to counter vaccine-related
               misinformation, the spokesperson says. If a user clicks on an
               anti-vax hashtag or content related to vaccine misinformation,
               Instagram will display a pop-up message showing educational
               materials about vaccination. Exact details on the design of the
               pop-up and when it will roll out are still in the works, the
               spokesperson says, but it appears to be modeled on similar
               pop-ups that appear for user searches related to opioid use and
               self-harm, which Instagram says have been successful.
               </p>
               <p>
               Instagram also plans to change its policies regarding account
               removal, as first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/08/instagram-new-account-removal-policy-bans-bad-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> by <em>Engadget</em>. Currently,
               users are only banned for violating Instagram&rsquo;s guidelines if
               "a certain percentage" of the posts they have made within an
               undisclosed window of time are found to go against the
               company&rsquo;s policies. Instagram will soon switch to a more
               straightforward strikes-based system, with the number of
               violations required for removal staying consistent among all
               users, the spokesperson confirmed.

               </p>
               <p>
               A few years ago I stood in a cramped trailer beside the busy
               110 freeway in Los Angeles as researchers at the University of
               Southern California gathered soot thrown off by vehicles
               pounding by just a few yards from their instruments, which
               rattled whenever a heavy truck passed. I was there to learn
               about how scientists were beginning to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-community-is-advocating-for-air-qualitywith-science/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               link air pollution</a>&mdash;from power plants, motor vehicles,
               <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-californias-smoke-getting-worse-its-complicated/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               forest fires</a>, you name it&mdash;to one of the least understood
               and most frightening of illnesses: <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/worth-worrying-dementia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dementia</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
               At that time, as I reported in <em><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/06/air-pollution-dementia-alzheimers-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mother Jones</a></em>, the research implicating
               <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-epas-pollution-estimates-stink-everyone-uses-them-anyway/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               air pollution</a> as one factor that can contribute to dementia
               was alarming, consistent, and, ultimately, &ldquo;suggestive.&rdquo; Since
               then scientists have published a wave of studies that reveal
               that air pollution is much worse for us than we had previously
               imagined. The evidence is so compelling, in fact, that many
               leading researchers now believe it&rsquo;s conclusive. &ldquo;I have no
               hesitation whatsoever to say that air pollution causes
               dementia,&rdquo; says Caleb Finch, gerontologist and the leader of
               USC&rsquo;s Air Pollution and Brain Disease research network, which
               has completed many of these new studies. In terms of its
               effects on our health and welfare, Finch says, &ldquo;air pollution
               is just as bad as cigarette smoke.&rdquo; This evidence arrives
               alongside the alarming news that air quality is actually
               <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/key-findings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worsening</a> for many cities in the United
               States, while the Trump Administration continues its effort to
               <a href="http://www.environmentalintegrity.org/trump-watch-epa/regulatory-rollbacks/#air" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delay or roll back</a> environmental
               safeguards.
               </p>
               <p>
               What makes Finch&mdash;and the half dozen other researchers I talked
               to&mdash;so sure? Of all the new research, three studies in
               particular paint a stark picture of the extent to which the
               quality of our air can determine whether we will age with our
               minds intact. In one from 2018, researchers <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/9/e022404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">followed</a> 130,000 older adults living in London for
               several years. Those exposed to higher levels of air
               pollutants, particularly nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate
               matter released by fossil fuel combustion, were significantly
               more likely to develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease&mdash;the most common kind
               of dementia&mdash;than their otherwise demographically matched peers.
               In total, Londoners exposed to the highest levels of air
               pollution were about one and a half times more likely to
               develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s across the study period than their
               neighbors exposed to the lowest levels&mdash;a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replication of previous findings</a> from Taiwan,
               where air pollution levels are much higher.

               </div>
               <p>
               Another, a 2017 study <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2816%2932399-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> in the Lancet, followed all
               adults living in Ontario (roughly 6 and a half million people)
               for over a decade and found that those who lived closer to
               major high-traffic roads were significantly more likely to
               develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease across the study period regardless
               of their health at baseline or socioeconomic status. Both of
               these studies estimated that around 6 to 7 percent of all
               dementia cases in their samples could be attributed to air
               pollution exposures.
               </p>

               </div>
               <p>
               Those studies from Canada and the UK are certainly intriguing.
               But the most compelling, and least reported on, study comes
               from the United States. It was also, incidentally, inspired by
               our previous reporting.
               </p>
               <p>
               Following our early report on the link between air pollution
               and dementia, three economists at Arizona State
               University&mdash;Kelly Bishop, Nicolai Kuminoff, and Jonathan
               Ketcham&mdash;decided to pursue a large-scale investigation of the
               issue. &ldquo;We found the <em>Mother Jones</em> article compelling,&rdquo;
               Ketcham says. &ldquo;It was informative about the plausible pathways
               and the need for more rigorous studies that could test
               causality.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               Ultimately, Bishop, Kuminoff, and Ketcham decided to link EPA
               air quality data to 15 years of Medicare records for 6.9
               million Americans over the age of 65. Rather than simply ask if
               Americans exposed to more air pollution developed dementia at
               higher rates, the team identified a quasi-natural experiment
               that arbitrarily separated Americans into higher and lower air
               pollution exposure groups. In 2005, the US Environmental
               Protection Agency targeted 132 counties in 21 states for
               increased regulation because they were found to be in violation
               of new air quality standards for fine particulate matter
               pollution. Residents of those counties consequently saw their
               air quality improve at a faster rate than their demographically
               matched peers living in other counties who, initially, had
               equal exposures but lived in counties with pollution levels
               that just barely fell below the new air quality standards.
               </p>
               <p>
               This quirk of different standards across the country allowed
               the researchers to ask if a manipulated decrease in air
               pollution exposure actually led to fewer cases of dementia,
               from Alzheimer&rsquo;s or other dementing diseases, like strokes.
               This overcame a significant limitation of the other existing
               studies, which could only compare differences in exposure and
               disease arising &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; among people who lived in different
               places rather than by a planned intervention. &ldquo;If people who
               have lower levels of education, who are less wealthy, and who
               are less healthy for reasons that we can&rsquo;t observe end up
               living in more polluted areas,&rdquo; says Ketcham, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s difficult
               to say which of those factors could have led to disease.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               As they <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> in the National Bureau of Economic
               Research last year, Bishop, Kuminoff, and Ketcham determined
               that air pollution could indeed cause dementia, specifically
               Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia. In counties that had to quickly comply
               with the new air quality standards, older people developed
               Alzheimer&rsquo;s at lower rates than their peers in counties where
               the new rules didn&rsquo;t apply. Annual exposure to an average of
               one more microgram of fine particle pollution per cubic meter
               of air (an amount well within the range of difference you could
               see if you moved from a clean neighborhood to a more polluted
               neighborhood) raised the typical US elder&rsquo;s risk of dementia as
               if they had aged 2.7 additional years. The authors estimated
               that the size of this elevated risk approached that of other
               well-known dementia drivers, including hypertension and heart
               disease.

               All told, Ketcham says, enforcing the EPA&rsquo;s stricter air
               quality standard likely resulted in 140,000 fewer people living
               with dementia by 2014. He places the economic value of that
               avoided disease burden at around $163 billion.

               Researchers now better understand what happens in the brain
               when you breathe polluted air&mdash;and how that can lead to
               neurodegeneration years later. When you inhale pollutants, the
               smallest particles, emitted by cars, power plants, and other
               places where fuel is burned, lodge in your lungs&rsquo; sensitive
               tissue or else pass into your blood stream. In those places
               they trigger an immune response that seeks to trap, contain,
               and remove the invading particles. In time that response
               generalizes to what we call &ldquo;systemic inflammation,&rdquo; or an
               over-active, overly excited immune response across the body.
               </p>
               <p>
               Systemic inflammation appears to be the primary way that air
               pollution harms the brain, says Caleb Finch. In early 2017
               Finch and his colleagues showed that inflammation following air
               pollution exposure leads to the formation of Alzheimer&rsquo;s
               plaques in the brains of mice genetically altered to develop
               Alzheimer&rsquo;s pathology. &ldquo;That was impressive,&rdquo; says George
               Martin, Director Emeritus of the University of Washington&rsquo;s
               Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Research Center, who was not involved in
               the study. Because of that study, and others like it, Martin
               now believes that air pollution could be one potential cause of
               dementia, although he wants more evidence on the mechanisms,
               &ldquo;and, ideally, on a specific component or components of air
               pollution.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               In the coming years, these new findings could shape scientists&rsquo;
               understanding of neurodegenerative disease. Because of these
               new studies, says George Perry, Chief Scientist of the Brain
               Health Consortium at the University of Texas at San Antonio and
               Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease, &ldquo;my view
               of Alzheimer&rsquo;s is changing, and I think the field is changing
               with it.&rdquo; Perry now believes that air pollution is a potential
               risk factor for dementia, and his Alzheimer&rsquo;s journal will soon
               run a special issue devoted to the link between the two.
               Motivated, in part, by the new evidence, Perry also
               increasingly sees dementia as a disease like cancer, where
               multiple factors could lead to pathology. &ldquo;People develop
               cancer without smoking or being exposed to air pollution,&rdquo; he
               says, &ldquo;But each of those will raise your risk.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               Unlike with smoking, we can&rsquo;t always know when we are being
               exposed to dirty air, and we can&rsquo;t decide when to quit. Yet
               Arizona State&rsquo;s Kuminoff firmly believes that we could avoid
               more dementia by strengthening our existing air pollution
               standards. If there is a safe level of exposure, he says, &ldquo;We
               haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet.&rdquo;

               person, it's easy to feel like you don't exist. The most common

               outright prejudice, or literal threats&mdash;it's being ignored. It's
               the sense that most people around you, those you know and those
               you don't, fail to consider your distinct perspective and the
               humanity associated with it. It's the violence of sensing that,

               the American population&mdash;<a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roughly 0.6 percent</a> in conservative
               estimates, roughly as many people as the population of
               Philadelphia&mdash;the world isn't built to even acknowledge you. Let
               alone accommodate you.

               This problem isn't unique to the United States. Trans people
               exist globally, and our experiences, of exclusion and
               ignorance, are nearly universally felt. Some countries have it
               better than us, and some have it worse, but no country,
               including America, has it particularly well.
               </p>

               <em>Last Day of Spring</em> is a game by npckc, a Japanese
               developer who specializes in, per <a href="https://www.patreon.com/npckc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their own
               words</a>, "cute LGBT+-friendly games." Along with its prequel,
               <em>One Night Hot Springs</em>, it tells a story about a
               Japanese trans woman, Haru, and her personal struggles to
               achieve a sense of stability and selfhood in her everyday life.
               The games are about, in other words, the problem of not
               existing. When I play them, they sting with familiarity.
               </p>
               <p>
               Representation, as a concept, is a loaded one, and it can (and
               has been) easily co-opted to support all sorts of things that
               don't actually affirm the perspectives or talents of
               marginalized people. But, at its core, representation is this:
               a mirror held up to you to remind you that, regardless of what
               society tells you, you <em>do</em> exist. Your experiences are
               real, which means art can be created about them, which also
               means they can be rendered poignant, and powerful, and
               important.
               </p>
               <p>
               <em>Last Day of Spring</em> does this in a simple, charming
               way. It's a visual novel, a game largely about talking to
               people and making simple narrative choices, told from the
               perspective of Haru's friend Erika. Erika wants to do something
               special for Haru's birthday, and so she decides to plan her
               friend a spa day. This proves challenging, as the spas she
               reaches out to aren't accommodating to trans women, and Erika
               has to reckon with her own privilege as a cisgender person
               while also figuring out how to best care for a friend she loves
               dearly.

               <p>
               <em>Last Day of Spring</em> feels like an honest look at
               Haru's struggle to find safety in a society built to
               exclude her from the very concept.

               <p>
               The characters are written deftly in <em>Spring</em>, and the
               focus on Erika as a viewpoint character, rather than sidelining
               Haru's experiences, ends up giving them a sounding board. Haru
               is regularly encouraged to voice her experiences to Erika, and
               as the game goes on, Erika's perspective, and the perspective
               of the player with it, is continuously reset in order to more
               closely align with the realities of Haru's lived experience.
               Haru comes across as an anxious, uncertain protagonist, but not
               in a fetishizing way that paints trans women as frail. Instead,
               it feels like an honest look at Haru's struggle to find safety
               in a society built to exclude her from the very concept. Haru's
               experiences are realistic, and her uncertainty and frustration
               at the world makes her more resonant as a protagonist, not
               less.

               It's easy, in articles about games like this, to perform
               surprise at such a trans-affirming game coming from a clearly
               Japanese perspective. There is, in many Western LGBTQ+
               communities, a knee-jerk Western chauvinism that takes the form
               of an assumption that affirming queer perspectives are
               exclusively or primarily the purview of subcultures in the
               United States and Western Europe, and that anything produced
               outside of that bubble must be an exception to a rule. But
               games like <em>Last Day of Spring</em> and SWERY's <em>The
               Missing</em> gesture toward active LGBTQ+-affirming voices as
               ongoing presences in Japanese games, while the lack of such
               voices in the mainstreams of both Japanese and Western game
               industries points to a more global failure, one that Americans
               certainly have no room to act smug about.

               <em>Last Day of Spring</em> and games like it make me feel more
               real, my experiences more visible. I recommend it, not because
               it will help readers who are not trans "<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/771843975909171202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get woke to the transgender experience</a>,"
               nor solely because I think my trans readers will like it. I
               don't necessarily believe in games as empathy builders&mdash;as ways
               to educate outsiders about marginalized perspectives, as though
               empathy is something that can be forced upon someone with an
               appealing presentation. What I do believe, instead, is that
               trans people are a part of the continuity of humanity, that our
               experiences are fundamentally human ones. In order to see most
               clearly what it means to be a person, our experiences, along
               with the variety of experiences of other marginalized groups,
               need to be seen. I recommend <em>Last Day of Spring</em>
               because it sees us, and because I wish you would, too.

               sketchy</a> election last year&mdash;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/georgia-governor-signs-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-law-11557266086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed into law</a> a ban on abortions after
               more than six weeks of pregnancy. That made Georgia the sixth
               state to institute such a ban, and the fourth this year (Ohio&rsquo;s
               elected officials <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712455980/a-bill-banning-most-abortions-becomes-law-in-ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put theirs in place</a> in April), with seven
               <em>more</em> states <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2019/03/surge-bans-abortion-early-six-weeks-most-people-know-they-are-pregnant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kicking around the idea</a>. It&rsquo;s not even the
               most aggressive anti-abortion concept; the Alabama state senate
               is set to vote today on a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/05/11/could-miscarriages-land-women-jail-lets-clarify-these-georgia-alabama-abortion-bills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bill</a> that, if it became law, would make
               performing an abortion a crime punishable by up to 99 years in
               prison. They&rsquo;re all part of a nationwide push, with more than
               300 bills in 2019, to try to make the procedure illegal.
               </p>
               <p>
               The political aim of so-called heartbeat bills is pretty clear.
               Some Americans would like to ban abortion altogether, but the
               Supreme Court says that&rsquo;s unconstitutional. So they advocate
               for increasingly draconian laws that walk up to that line. Less
               straightforward, though, is the science. What the bills call a
               heartbeat&mdash;it's not that.
               </p>
               <p>
               These bills generally say that a &ldquo;fetal heartbeat&rdquo; helps
               predict whether a pregnancy will result in a living baby; the
               <a href="http://f2a.org/images/Model_Heartbeat_Bill_Apr._2019_version.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model legislation</a> many states use refers to
               that fetal cardiac activity as a marker of &ldquo;an unborn human
               individual,&rdquo; defining a moment where alive-ness starts. And,
               yes, it&rsquo;s true that detection of cardiac rhythm is a marker for
               the health of a pregnancy and a good sign that it&rsquo;ll
               continue&mdash;that, if everything works out, it&rsquo;ll result in the
               birth of a living baby. &ldquo;Detecting a fetal heartbeat can be a
               sign that there is a pregnancy developing, and that&rsquo;s a sign we
               use to reassure people,&rdquo; says Sarah Horvath, an ob-gyn with the
               American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
               </p>
               <p>
               But beyond that, the science here needs a lot of unpacking.
               First, you have to note the use of the phrase &ldquo;unborn human
               individual;&rdquo; this part of the debate over abortion depends on
               whether you think a 3- to 4-millimeter-long, partially
               organized blob of cells is a human individual or not. It also
               depends on whether you think the government or the person in
               whom those cells reside gets to make that determination.
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               From there, the issue is what that &ldquo;heartbeat&rdquo; actually is. &ldquo;At
               six weeks, the embryo is forming what will eventually develop
               into mature systems. There&rsquo;s an immature neurological system,
               and there&rsquo;s a very immature cardiovascular system,&rdquo; says
               Jennifer Kerns, an ob-gyn at UC San Francisco and director of
               research in obstetrics and gynecology at Zuckerberg San
               Francisco General Hospital. The rhythm specified in the
               six-week abortion bans, she says, &ldquo;is a group of cells with
               electrical activity. That&rsquo;s what the heartbeat is at that stage
               of gestation &hellip; We are in no way talking about any kind of
               cardiovascular system.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               In part because that rhythm is a sign of the health of the
               developing embryo, scientists have worked to push backward the
               moment in pregnancy they can detect it. In 1984 they were
               <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6392578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pretty psyched</a> to pick up fetal cardiac activity
               at between 41 and 43 days of gestation&mdash;six weeks. The
               researchers described it as a &ldquo;tiny blinking, flashing, and/or
               rocking echo with a regular rhythm,&rdquo; which is how scientists
               say something has a good beat and you can dance to it. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
               really happening at that point is that our ultrasound
               technology has gotten good enough to be able to detect
               electrical activity in a rudimentary group of cells,&rdquo; Horvath
               says.
               </p>
               <p>
               But if you&rsquo;re thinking about this as something that looks
               roughly like a person with something that looks roughly like a
               chest, inside which something that looks roughly like a
               valentine is going pitter-pat (or lubdub-lubdub), you&rsquo;re
               picturing the wrong thing. As the ob-gyn Jen Gunter <a href="https://drjengunter.com/2016/12/11/dear-press-stop-calling-them-heartbeat-bills-and-call-them-fetal-pole-cardiac-activity-bills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> three years ago, this is, more
               technically, &ldquo;fetal pole cardiac activity.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a cluster of
               pulsing cells. &ldquo;In the mouse embryo, for example, there is a
               definite cardiac rhythm in the tiny, little, immature heart at
               8.5 days of development, but it is certainly not enough to
               support viability,&rdquo; says Janet Rossant, senior scientist and
               chief of research emeritus at the Hospital for Sick Children in
               Toronto. &ldquo;It is just helping to encourage the development of an
               organized vasculature and circulatory system&mdash;a prerequisite for
               future viability but not sufficient alone.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               That&rsquo;s the other wobbly term of art here: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/science-cant-say-babys-life-begins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">viability</a>.&rdquo;
               In common parlance, people sometimes use that word to describe
               a baby far enough along in gestation to survive outside a
               woman&rsquo;s womb. In humans, that takes about 24 weeks, give or
               take (every pregnancy is different, and so are the skill sets
               of every hospital and every neonatal intensive care unit). But
               that&rsquo;s not what clinicians mean. &ldquo;It means a pregnancy that, at
               that point in time, looks like it&rsquo;s normal to continue,&rdquo; Kerns
               says.
               </p>
               <p>
               Science doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a strong point of many states&rsquo;
               anti-abortion bills. You might have read about an <a href="https://www.statenews.org/post/ohio-legislature-considering-abortion-bill-more-restrictive-heartbeat-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional bill</a> Ohio is considering that
               would ban most birth control and require the surgical
               reimplantation of ectopic pregnancies, a
               dangerous-to-the-mother condition in which an embryo implants
               somewhere other than the uterus. That&rsquo;s not something
               scientists know how to do. (&ldquo;No. Just never. I mean, never.
               Never ever,&rdquo; Kerns says. &ldquo;Ectopic pregnancies are medical
               emergencies.&rdquo;) And indeed, courts have largely judged six weeks
               to be unreasonably early for pregnant people to realize they&rsquo;re
               pregnant and get an abortion. None of the state laws banning
               abortion at six weeks are in effect; some are too new, some
               were overturned by courts, and others are under legal
               challenge.
               </p>
               <p>
               To opponents, the six-week bans&rsquo; deployment of science&mdash;or at
               least scientific language&mdash;sounds like an attempt to challenge
               those rulings. &ldquo;Using the word <em>heartbeat</em> here is an
               intentional obfuscation,&rdquo; Kerns says. &ldquo;Hearing the word
               <em>heartbeat</em> plays upon people&rsquo;s emotions &hellip; when in fact
               what it does is effectively ban abortions for many people,
               because many people don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re pregnant at six
               weeks.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               Yet many state bills use a six-week clock and fetal cardiac
               activity as a basis for policymaking. &ldquo;I do think there&rsquo;s a
               deliberate conflation of terms going on in legislation in order
               to try to co-opt the science, or at least the scientific
               language,&rdquo; Horvath says. &ldquo;These bans are really just
               arbitrarily chosen points in time in a pregnancy that are
               strictly there because they want a complete ban on abortion
               care.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               This kind of slippery language and shoddy science has
               consequences. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t an attempt to put a veneer of
               scientific finality over a difficult ethical question, it&rsquo;d
               still open up the possibility of serious health risks to
               pregnant women. Some of the legislation under consideration
               doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge the possibility of a miscarriage after
               detection of fetal cardiac activity, meaning women who do
               miscarry could be subject to prosecution&mdash;which could deter them
               from seeking necessary prenatal medical care. &ldquo;We absolutely
               know that when you ban abortion, maternal mortality increases,&rdquo;
               Kerns says. &ldquo;But in addition, it marginalizes poor women and
               women of color, who are often the ones who can&rsquo;t then access
               abortion across state lines, who can&rsquo;t take days off of work,
               organize child care, and have the finances. It just exacerbates
               what&rsquo;s already an inequitable system.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               But the confirmation of Trump nominee Brett Kavanaugh to the
               Supreme Court tipped the balance of that court toward the
               right. Abortion opponents see the possibility that the new
               lineup would vote to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, the
               landmark decision that legalized abortion in the United States,
               if the right case came before it. Aggressive bans like
               heartbeat bills or any of the other 300 anti-abortion laws
               passed in the first quarter of 2019 could be it. Fetal cardiac
               activity&rsquo;s usefulness as a diagnostic marker might turn out to
               be less important than the powerful noise it could make in
               Washington.

               <p>
               <span>President Trump has</span> never been coy
               about his desire to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
               While that pledge has faced <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/want-understand-trumps-health-care-implosion-play-ultimatum-game/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               setbacks in Congress</a>, his administration has managed to gut
               Obamacare by other means, like cutting <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announcement-aca-navigator-program-and-promotion-upcoming-open-enrollment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial support</a>. The executive branch can
               also undermine the law in subtler ways. According to a new
               report, the Trump administration has been systematically wiping
               crucial information about the ACA from government websites over
               the past two years. Unlike changes to funding, these
               modifications often happen with little fanfare or government
               oversight, but they can still have a dramatic impact on
               Americans' access to health care resources.
               </p>
               <p>
               The report was published Wednesday by the Sunlight Foundation,
               an open government group whose <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/web-integrity-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Integrity Project</a> monitors some 30,000
               government pages for updates and alterations. Looking at sites
               administered by the Department for Health and Human Services,
               it documents 26 instances in which information related to the
               Affordable Care Act was substantially altered or removed. Some
               of the changes were subtle. Others, including the disappearance
               of an 85-page website devoted to the ACA, were sweeping. Taken
               together, the researchers argue, the modifications are
               tantamount to government censorship and point to an increasing
               need for oversight of government websites.
               </p>

               "People rely on government information, and there&rsquo;s a
               presumption of objectivity that comes from the [government]
               address," says Sarah John, director of research for the Web
               Integrity Project and one of the paper's coauthors. "If a
               website says one thing one day and a different thing the next
               day, what is a citizen to make of that?" HHS did not respond to
               a request for comment.

               That the Trump administration would whittle away at these
               online resources may not come as a surprise; it has already
               effectively gutted the financial resources that the Obama
               administration dedicated to promoting the law. Shortly after
               President Trump took office, the Center for Medicare and
               Medicaid Services <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announcement-aca-navigator-program-and-promotion-upcoming-open-enrollment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> it would cut funding for
               Affordable Care Act&ndash;related outreach and advertising by 90
               percent, from $100 million to $10 million. The following year,
               the center <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/07/10/obamacare-cuts-mean-groups-have-less-sign-up-customers/773728002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slashed</a> funding even further for so-called
               navigators, who help people sign up for insurance.

               The website changes appear to be an extension of this strategy
               to make it harder for the average American, and particularly
               the most vulnerable Americans, to find information about
               coverage. Among the biggest changes was the removal of an
               entire <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/8498/20170131004402/https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts-and-features/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">85-page website</a> listing "facts and
               features" about the ACA. It had included 29 fact sheets about
               the law, as well as a breakdown of the impact of the law in
               each state.
               </p>
               <p>
               Other changes appeared to take direct aim at communities that
               have been disproportionately uninsured or who would be entitled
               to special benefits under the ACA. Some time in the weeks after
               President Trump's inauguration, for example, the Affordable
               Care Act page on the website for the Office of Minority Health
               was removed. Later, a page offering guidance for American
               Indians and Alaska Natives was also removed. The Department of
               Health and Human Services removed multiple pieces of content
               noting that women could no longer be charged more or denied
               coverage under the ACA, and the Office of Women's Health
               removed a page informing women about breast cancer screening
               options. Still another page on MentalHealth.gov was altered to
               remove text explaining that most health plans cover
               preventative services like depression screening and behavioral
               assessments for children.
               </p>
               <p>
               In most cases, the government made these changes without any
               official announcement. "What&rsquo;s interesting and potentially
               dangerous about website changes is they can be done without due
               process," says Rachel Bergman, director of the Web Integrity
               Project and another coauthor on the report. "Ultimately it can
               have the same consequences as a formal policy change."

               <p>
               Many of the modifications and removals do mirror formal
               policies the administration is pursuing. In August of 2018,
               several agencies <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180801.169759/full/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finalized a rule</a> to expand what are known
               as short-term, limited-duration insurance plans, which aren't
               bound by the ACA. That means that under those plans, women
               <em>can</em> be <a href="https://nwlc.org/blog/how-short-term-limited-duration-insurance-plans-being-pushed-by-the-trump-administration-shortchange-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charged more</a> for insurance, and people can
               be turned down for preexisting conditions. That could explain
               why some changes to government websites appear to downplay the
               rights afforded to people under the ACA. Similarly, the
               researchers found that some training materials for navigators
               had been removed, echoing the administration's broader
               reduction of the navigator program.

               <p>
               Some changes the researchers discovered may appear tiny but
               could have a big impact. On one Frequently Asked Questions page
               maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services, a
               page called "Affordable Care Act" was replaced with a page
               called "Health Insurance Reform." It's a slight difference, but
               according to Josh Peck, former chief marketing officer for
               Healthcare.gov, it matters.
               </p>
               <p>
               During the Obama administration, Peck says, search engine
               advertising was a key driver of new signups. Now that the
               advertising budget has been drastically reduced, organic
               searches for information related to the ACA are even more
               critical. And yet, he says, "Something as simple as changing
               'Affordable Care Act' to 'health care law' can have a big
               impact on search engine optimization." Tinkering with the
               language in this way could force government websites farther
               down the page of Google results for certain queries, boosting
               websites and paid ads placed by companies that aren't always
               reputable.
               </p>
               <p>
               "There&rsquo;s some unscrupulous actors out there who are happy to
               pose as government entities to mislead consumers," Peck says.

               </div>
               <p>
               Peck says it's important to remember that these changes don't
               happen by accident. "It is a choice," he says. "Someone has to
               proactively go through the bureaucracy to take it all down."
               </p>
               <p>
               The problem is, once government officials decide to take this
               information down, they rarely tell the public or leave any
               trace, beyond what exists in internet archives like the Wayback
               Machine. For a long time, this wasn't a huge issue. The George
               W. Bush administration disseminated far fewer policies and
               resources via government websites than the Obama administration
               did. But in the digital age, it stands to reason that each
               incoming occupant of the Oval Office will want to overhaul
               government websites to reflect their own priorities. Some past
               administration's pages do get <a href="https://www.state.gov/misc/112234.htm#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archived</a>, but these archives don't always cover
               incremental changes over time.
               </p>
               <p>
               The Sunlight Foundation researchers believe the US needs a
               system that tracks all of those changes. Specifically, they
               propose that government agencies write formal memos to propose
               website changes, maintain archives of content that's been
               removed, and issue press releases on those removals. This, they
               say, would at least create a digital trail and lend some
               transparency to the process.
               </p>
               <p>
               It's difficult to measure the exact impact website changes have
               had on people seeking coverage under the ACA. Under the Trump
               administration, enrollment in the ACA has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/health/obamacare-enrollment-aca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declined</a> substantially, but that decline
               undoubtedly has a lot to do with the reduction in outreach and
               the elimination of the so-called individual mandate, which
               penalized people for forgoing insurance. The report's authors
               are careful not to draw a straight line between this drop and
               the website changes. But it's hard not to see how they're part
               of a larger pattern. As Bergman put it, "A public that is less
               aware and knowledgeable about the law is less likely to access
               important health care services the ACA affords."

      <![CDATA[<div>
               <p>
               <span>This week, Microsoft</span> issued patches
               for 79 flaws across its platforms and products. One of them
               merits particular attention: a bug so bad that <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/still-use-windows-xp-prepare-worst/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               Microsoft released a fix for it on Windows XP</a>, an operating
               system it officially abandoned five years ago.
               </p>
               <p>
               There&rsquo;s maybe no better sign of a vulnerability&rsquo;s severity; the
               last time Microsoft bothered to make a Windows XP fix publicly
               available was a little over two years ago, in the months before
               the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/ransomware-meltdown-experts-warned/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
               WannaCry ransomware attack swept the globe</a>. This week&rsquo;s
               vulnerability has similarly devastating implications. In fact,
               Microsoft itself has drawn a direct parallel.
               </p>
               <p>
               &ldquo;Any future malware that exploits this vulnerability could
               propagate from vulnerable computer to vulnerable computer in a
               similar way as the WannaCry malware spread across the globe in
               2017,&rdquo; Simon Pope, director of incident response for the
               Microsoft Security Response Center, <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2019/05/14/prevent-a-worm-by-updating-remote-desktop-services-cve-2019-0708/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in a statement announcing the patch
               Tuesday. &ldquo;It is highly likely that malicious actors will write
               an exploit for this vulnerability and incorporate it into their
               malware.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               Microsoft is understandably withholding specifics about the
               bug, noting only that it hadn&rsquo;t seen an attack in action yet,
               and that the flaw relates to Remote Desktop Services, a feature
               that lets administrators take control of another computer
               that&rsquo;s on the same network.
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               That small parcel of information, though, still gives potential
               attackers plenty enough to go on. &ldquo;Even mention that the area
               of interest is Remote Desktop Protocol is sufficient to uncover
               the vulnerability,&rdquo; says Jean Taggart, senior security
               researcher at security firm Malwarebytes.
               </p>
               <div>
               <div>
               <div></div>
               </div>
               </div>
               <p>
               Expect that to happen quickly. &ldquo;This will be fully automated in
               the next 24 to 48 hours and exploited by a worm,&rdquo; says Pieter
               Danhieux, CEO of secure coding platform Secure Code Warrior,
               referring to the class of malware that can propagate across a
               network without any human interaction, such as clicking the
               wrong link or opening the wrong attachment. Like <em>The
               Blob</em>, it just spreads.
               </p>
               <p>
               Once that worm gives hackers access to those devices, the
               possibilities are fairly limitless. Danhieux sees ransomware as
               a likely path; Taggart ticks off spam campaigns, DDOS, and data
               harvesting as possibilities. &ldquo;Take your pick,&rdquo; he adds.
               &ldquo;Suffice to say, a lot.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               The saving grace to all of this is that computers running
               Windows 8 on up aren&rsquo;t affected. But it&rsquo;s important not to
               underestimate the danger that Windows XP computers can still
               pose. Estimates vary, but analytics company Net Marketshare
               says that <a href="https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22platformVersion%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22platformsDesktopVersions%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222018-05%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222019-04%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3.57 percent</a> of all desktops and laptops
               still run Windows XP, which was first released in 2001.
               Conservatively, that's still tens of millions of devices on
               Windows XP&mdash;more than are running on the most recent version of
               MacOS. Moreover, you can assume with some confidence that
               almost none of those computers are ready for what&rsquo;s coming.

               <p>
               Yes, plenty of Windows XP users are just folks who haven&rsquo;t
               dusted off their Dell Dimension tower since the last Bush
               administration. It seems unlikely that they'll ever get around
               to installing this latest patch, especially given that you need
               to seek it out, and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4500705/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download and install</a> it yourself. It&rsquo;s hard
               enough to get people to update modern systems with their
               incessant nagging popups; one imagines that those still on
               Windows XP are in no rush to visit the Microsoft Update
               Catalog.
               </p>
               <p>
               More troubling, though, are the countless businesses and
               infrastructure concerns that rely still on Windows XP. As
               recently as 2016, even <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a19061/britains-doomsday-subs-run-windows-xp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuclear submarines</a> had it on board. For the
               most sensitive use cases&mdash;like, say, nukes&mdash;companies and
               governments pay Microsoft for continued security support. But
               the bulk of hospitals, businesses, and industrial plants that
               have Windows XP in their systems don&rsquo;t. And for many of those,
               upgrading&mdash;or even installing a patch&mdash;is more difficult than it
               might seem.
               </p>
               <p>
               &ldquo;Patching computers in industrial control networks is
               challenging because they often operate 24/7 controlling
               large-scale physical processes like oil refining and
               electricity generation,&rdquo; says Phil Neray, vice president of
               industrial cybersecurity at CyberX, an IoT and ICS-focused
               security firm. Recent CyberX research indicates that more than
               half of industrial sites run unsupported Windows machines,
               making them potentially vulnerable. There&rsquo;s not much
               opportunity to test the impact of a patch on those types of
               systems, much less to interrupt operations to install them.
               </p>
               <p>
               That applies to health care systems, too, where the process of
               updating critical software could interrupt patient care. Other
               businesses run specialized software that&rsquo;s incompatible with
               more recent Windows releases; practically speaking, they&rsquo;re
               trapped on XP. And while the best way to protect yourself from
               this latest vulnerability&mdash;and the countless others that at this
               point plague unsupported operating systems&mdash;is to upgrade to the
               latest version of Windows, cash-strapped businesses tend to
               prioritize other needs.
               </p>
               <p>
               With any luck, Microsoft&rsquo;s extraordinary step of pushing a
               patch will spur many of them to action. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a
               louder siren. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re dealing with patching, it&rsquo;s a
               balancing act between the costs of patching and the costs of
               leaving it alone, or just asking users to upgrade,&rdquo; says
               Richard Ford, chief scientist at cybersecurity firm Forcepoint.
               &ldquo;They would have a grasp of both the security risk&mdash;and the
               reputational risk&mdash;of not going after this vulnerability
               aggressively. Put those all together, and when the stars align
               it makes a lot of sense to provide the patch, quickly, safely,
               and even for operating systems that are out of support.&rdquo;
               </p>
               <p>
               The coming weeks and months should show, though, just how wide
               a gap exists between providing a patch and getting people to
               install it. An attack on Windows XP is at this point
               inevitable. And the fallout might be worse than you&rsquo;d have
               guessed.

               To recap, I am an advisor for the

               inclusivity for LGBTQ+ people has
               become a serious passion of mine.

               that</span><br><span>
               I even have to say that, because WE&rsquo;RE

               One section of the course directed you
               an article titled</span><br><a href="https://medium.com/gender-inclusivit/why-i-put-pronouns-on-my-email-signature-and-linkedin-profile-and-you-should-too-d3dc942c8743" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>
               Why I Put Pronouns on my Email
               Signature and LinkedIn Profile and You
               Should Too</span></a><span>.
               (I linked it</span><br><span>
               there, for your viewing pleasure.) It
               discusses why you should put your
               preferred pronouns on your</span><br><span>
               email signature, and even on
               your</span> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/betinabaessler" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>
               LinkedIn</span></a> <span>
               profile, regardless of your
               orientation. I immediately</span><br><span>
               added my pronouns to both (I had been
               meaning to add it to my email signature
               for a while anyway)</span><br><span>
               and then I found myself being hesitant
               about adding it to my work email. There
               are some people in</span><br><span>
               my department who I know don&rsquo;t agree
               with my views. What if they think less
               of me when they see my</span><br><span>
               signature? What if they think I&rsquo;m being
               silly? What if they think it&rsquo;s stupid?
               What if they confront me</span><br><span>
               about it and I do a terrible job of
               explaining why I have it because I'm an
               anxious mess?!</span>
               </div>
               <div dir="ltr">
               </div>
               <div dir="ltr">
               <span>
               Then I straightened up.</span>
               </div>
               <div dir="ltr">
               </div>
               <div dir="ltr">
               <span>
               So what if they do?!</span>

               <div dir="ltr">
               </div>
               <div dir="ltr">
               <span>
               The thing that prompted me to come out
               was the knowledge that people are more
               likely to be</span><br><span>
               accepting if they know someone in the
               LGBT community. If me coming out helps
               people to be more</span><br><span>
               accepting, more inclusive of others,
               then that&rsquo;s what I knew I had to do. In
               keeping up with that</span><br><span>
               thought, I have to put my preferred
               pronouns out there. If us cis folk (cis
               means you identify as the</span><br><span>
               sex you were born as) normalize putting
               our pronouns in our email signatures,
               so trans and</span><br><span>
               non-binary folk feel comfortable doing
               it, then maybe they&rsquo;ll worry a little
               less about being misgendered</span><br><span>
               in emails. I say that&rsquo;s worth
               it.</span>

               <div dir="ltr">
               <span>
               So add your pronouns to your email
               signatures, use the pronouns people
               prefer, and try to be a</span><br><span>
               good human. It&rsquo;s really not that

               This has been weighing pretty heavily on
               my mind lately. I&rsquo;ve kept my mouth shut
               for decades because I didn&rsquo;t think it was
               worth mentioning. With all the sexual
               harassment allegations flying around, and
               so many people saying they&rsquo;re being blown
               out of proportion or defending the
               abusers, I just can&rsquo;t keep quiet anymore.
               Seems as though I&rsquo;m losing the ability to
               keep my mouth shut about a lot these
               days! When I was in high school, before I
               got my drivers license, there was a boy
               on the bus who I considered my friend. He
               started making comments, pretty much
               daily, about my breasts. Sure, he was
               joking and meant no harm. But he didn&rsquo;t
               think about how I might feel about the
               comments. I&rsquo;d always change the subject.
               Being the non confrontational shy gal
               I&rsquo;ve always been, I couldn&rsquo;t just come
               right out and say he was making me
               uncomfortable.&nbsp; Then there was the
               boy at work &ndash; this would probably have
               been my senior year of high school &ndash; who
               started commenting on my breasts, and
               then actually gr&hellip;

               The above picture is an excellent
               portrayal of how far I&rsquo;ve gotten with
               packing. My youngest built a box fort
               while my eldest played on her phone.
               Meanwhile, I was going in and out of the
               house bringing empty boxes in and taking
               filled boxes to the car.<br><br>
               I&rsquo;m in a weird place today. When my
               husband said he wanted a divorce over a
               year ago, I was crushed. For months I
               felt lost and hopeless. I lost the home
               I&rsquo;d lived in for nearly ten years, mine
               and my childrens&rsquo; lives were turned
               upside down, and I felt like a complete
               failure.<br><br>
               Since then I have worked so hard to
               improve my situation. I got a new job, I
               moved several times before renting the
               trailer I&rsquo;ve been in for a year (the
               first place I&rsquo;ve ever had on my own), I
               got a new job, and have worked hard to
               improve my credit score.<br><br>
               I&rsquo;m happy with where my life is right
               now.<br><br>
               I decided I could have lower monthly
               payments (and SO much more room) if I
               owned instead of rented, and have worked
               for months to make that a reality. It&rsquo;s
               been hard&hellip;

               Part of having anxiety is being afraid to
               ask for help. Mostly it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t
               want to be an inconvenience, but I also
               have an intense fear of rejection. What
               if I asked and they said no?! I&rsquo;d die,
               probably.<br>
               This covers everything from needing to
               borrow money to needing help hanging a
               medicine cabinet. <i>It extra
               covers needing help with my mental state,
               but that&rsquo;s a whole other blog
               post.</i><br>
               I usually end up mentioning what I need
               help with in hopes that someone will
               offer to help, even though that&rsquo;s a
               chicken way to go about it. My ex
               couldn&rsquo;t understand why I wouldn&rsquo;t just
               come right out and ask. <i>I just
               can&rsquo;t!</i> Anxiety won&rsquo;t let me!<br>
               Today this particular aspect of anxiety
               hit me hard, twice.<br>
               Yesterday one of the bosses asked for my
               help with something. They&rsquo;re having
               students volunteer to come in and speak
               with our vendor about one of our websites
               so we know what needs to be improved. The
               boss man has an appointment and couldn&rsquo;t
               make it to some of these interviews, so
               he asked &hellip;

               Okay, so maybe there aren&rsquo;t really bears.
               I mean&hellip; there are bears, obviously, but
               not in my world. In my world, there is
               anxiety, depression, and everything that
               makes the two unbearable.
               </div>
               <div>
               <br></div>
               <div>
               I had months where I was actively
               stressed about buying a house and not
               being able to afford Christmas for my
               children. When those two were done and in
               the past, I settled into this weird state
               where I still felt the anxiety, but
               didn&rsquo;t have the thing to be anxious
               about. I was quiet for a while, not
               really wanting to talk as much as normal,
               and being sort of contemplative. I&rsquo;ve
               mostly come out of that and for a while
               felt really quite&hellip; <i>fine.</i>
               Maybe even, dare I say, <i>good.</i>
               </div>
               <div>
               <br></div>
               <div>
               Fast forward to today. I&rsquo;m an anxious,
               depressed mess. Why?
               </div>
               <div>
               <i><br></i>
               </div>
               <div>
               <i>My fucking
               shoe broke.</i>
               </div>
               <div>
               <br></div>
               <div>
               But also my mom doesn&rsquo;t like my haircut
               and I&rsquo;m still and will always be broke
               and a lady kept interrupting me and
               railroading me in a meeting, and I'll
               never get to buy my daughter her first
               bra because her dad already did it, and
               I&rsquo;m frustrated with myself because I need
               to learn to speak up for myself,
               goddammit, and I&rsquo;m lonely but I also want
               to be left alone and I&rsquo;m fat but I want
               to eat my feelings, my house is a mess
               and it&rsquo;s stressing me out but I&rsquo;m so
               stressed that I can&rsquo;t muster the spoons
               to clean, and all I want to do at all
               times is <b>just
               fucking sleep</b>.
               </div>
               <div>
               <br></div>
               <div>
               I think I&rsquo;d rather have actual bears to
               deal with. At least then I could just
               play dead and hope for the best. Maybe
               they&rsquo;d eat me and I&rsquo;d finally get that
               long nap&hellip;

               This has been weighing pretty heavily on
               my mind lately. I&rsquo;ve kept my mouth shut
               for decades because I didn&rsquo;t think it was
               worth mentioning. With all the sexual
               harassment allegations flying around, and
               so many people saying they&rsquo;re being blown
               out of proportion or defending the
               abusers, I just can&rsquo;t keep quiet anymore.
               Seems as though I&rsquo;m losing the ability to
               keep my mouth shut about a lot these
               days! When I was in high school, before I
               got my drivers license, there was a boy
               on the bus who I considered my friend. He
               started making comments, pretty much
               daily, about my breasts. Sure, he was
               joking and meant no harm. But he didn&rsquo;t
               think about how I might feel about the
               comments. I&rsquo;d always change the subject.
               Being the non confrontational shy gal
               I&rsquo;ve always been, I couldn&rsquo;t just come
               right out and say he was making me
               uncomfortable.&nbsp; Then there was the
               boy at work &ndash; this would probably have
               been my senior year of high school &ndash; who
               started commenting on my breasts, and
               then actually gr&hellip;

               The above picture is an excellent
               portrayal of how far I&rsquo;ve gotten with
               packing. My youngest built a box fort
               while my eldest played on her phone.
               Meanwhile, I was going in and out of the
               house bringing empty boxes in and taking
               filled boxes to the car.<br><br>
               I&rsquo;m in a weird place today. When my
               husband said he wanted a divorce over a
               year ago, I was crushed. For months I
               felt lost and hopeless. I lost the home
               I&rsquo;d lived in for nearly ten years, mine
               and my childrens&rsquo; lives were turned
               upside down, and I felt like a complete
               failure.<br><br>
               Since then I have worked so hard to
               improve my situation. I got a new job, I
               moved several times before renting the
               trailer I&rsquo;ve been in for a year (the
               first place I&rsquo;ve ever had on my own), I
               got a new job, and have worked hard to
               improve my credit score.<br><br>
               I&rsquo;m happy with where my life is right
               now.<br><br>
               I decided I could have lower monthly
               payments (and SO much more room) if I
               owned instead of rented, and have worked
               for months to make that a reality. It&rsquo;s
               been hard&hellip;

               Part of having anxiety is being afraid to
               ask for help. Mostly it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t
               want to be an inconvenience, but I also
               have an intense fear of rejection. What
               if I asked and they said no?! I&rsquo;d die,
               probably.<br>
               This covers everything from needing to
               borrow money to needing help hanging a
               medicine cabinet. <i>It extra
               covers needing help with my mental state,
               but that&rsquo;s a whole other blog
               post.</i><br>
               I usually end up mentioning what I need
               help with in hopes that someone will
               offer to help, even though that&rsquo;s a
               chicken way to go about it. My ex
               couldn&rsquo;t understand why I wouldn&rsquo;t just
               come right out and ask. <i>I just
               can&rsquo;t!</i> Anxiety won&rsquo;t let me!<br>
               Today this particular aspect of anxiety
               hit me hard, twice.<br>
               Yesterday one of the bosses asked for my
               help with something. They&rsquo;re having
               students volunteer to come in and speak
               with our vendor about one of our websites
               so we know what needs to be improved. The
               boss man has an appointment and couldn&rsquo;t
               make it to some of these interviews, so
               he asked &hellip;

      <![CDATA[<p>
               A dump called "Collection #1" has been released by parties unknown, containing email addresses and cracked passwords: in its raw form, it contains 2.7 billion records, which Troy "Have I Been Pwned" Hunt (<a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=haveibeenpwned" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previously</a>) de-duplicated to come up with 773 million unique records -- of those 140,000,000 email addresses and 10,000,000 passwords have never been seen in the HaveIBeenPwned database before.
               <span></span>
               </p><p>
               Collection #1 appears to have been created by cracking <em>lots</em> of online services of every size and description and subjecting their passwords to guessing programs that undid the hashing of millions and millions of them. It's the kind of database that is of great use to "credential stuffers" who just throw known-good login/password combinations at services they want to attack until they get in.
               </p><p>
               The dump is on "a popular hacking forum" (having previously been available on Mega, the cloud service). It's a folder with 12,000 files totalling 87GB.
               </p><p>
               Hunt has ingested this dump into the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Have I Been Pwned?</a> database, and you can search it to see if your credentials appear in it.
               
               </p><blockquote>
               <p>
               Pretty darn serious! While it doesn't appear to include more sensitive information, like credit card or Social Security numbers, Collection #1 is historic for scale alone. A few elements also make it especially unnerving. First, around 140 million email accounts and over 10 million unique passwords in Collection #1 are new to Hunt&rsquo;s database, meaning they&rsquo;re not just duplicates from prior megabreaches.
               </p><p>
               Then there&rsquo;s the way in which those passwords are saved in Collection #1. &ldquo;These are all plain text passwords; if we take a breach like Dropbox, there may have been 68 million unique email addresses in there but the passwords were cryptographically hashes making them very difficult to use,&rdquo; says Hunt. Instead, the only technical prowess someone with access to the folders needs to break into your accounts is the ability to scroll and click.
               </p></blockquote>
