# way to control which parsers get what with auto-runs?
    - that's really the thing to do 
    - all on UNLESS?
    - all/list of individuals?
    
# add archivers to hooty with link

# TO TEST
#################################################              


* Check parser doesn't choke if there's a newline at the end of the posts.db file

ADD "add to agaetr" to hooty 

test using user level systemd instead of cron as better way to have environment





#################################################              
# DONE
#################################################    
archiver outputs
test hooty
all other outputs
Add hashtag field to hooty
test add single url 
-- using single url (which i have to do anyway) duh
there's something that breaks when the image is bogus that needs to be debugged too.
# lengthen pulled description, shorten later.
Add link field to hooty?
use description2 format for hooty like in agaetr_send
Add image shrinker for alt text for hooty
preprocessor tested
pull in ---- 
* Check that send exits cleanly if there's no articles !!
test self_link output
           Hooty needs better control pathways in for determining what is on and not
Not using existing alt text when it's in the DB?
SCRIPT_DIR FOR SENDERS IS DIFFERENT -- FIX THAT AND HAVE IT NOT OVERWRITE THE VARIABLE
* ensure there's no "exit" calls in senders 
    if [ ${#link} -gt 36 ]; then 
        if [ -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/short_enabled/yourls.sh" ];then
            source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/yourls.sh"
            loud "Sending to shortener function"
            yourls_shortener
        fi

TUMBLR TEXT:  https://github.com/admacro/gotumblr
    pita, but hey.  Will need whole different output generator here.

# archive.is  -- add into readme
# swap wayback to waybackpy via pipx - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
#### incorporate adding these to the post
# archive.org - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
# archive.is -  https://github.com/palewire/archiveis
# removal of the short blurb

SO OUR FLOW WILL HAVE TO BE
- if archive.is,
    do first, capture url
- if internet archive
    do second, capture url
    (shorten that url)
single url 
holy crap, I've got duplicate functions, moron
# bespoke it.  Can't fix everyone's issue.
# toot
updated bsky
so need multiple toot configurations

toot auth -- lists them
toot activate selects them

or just tag -u [account] on the end.


remove configurators
