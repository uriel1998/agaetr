# Detect bullpuckey descriptions and replace with opengraph ones
# fix timeout with archivers

 
# way to control which parsers get what with auto-runs?
    - that's really the thing to do 
    - all on UNLESS?
    - all/list of individuals?
    
# add archivers to hooty with link

# TO TEST
#################################################              
# new bsky test both normally and with cron


* Check parser doesn't choke if there's a newline at the end of the posts.db file

ADD "add to agaetr" to hooty 

test using user level systemd instead of cron as better way to have environment

archiver outputs
test hooty
all other outputs
Add hashtag field to hooty
test add single url 
-- using single url (which i have to do anyway) duh
there's something that breaks when the image is bogus that needs to be debugged too.
# lengthen pulled description, shorten later.
Add link field to hooty?
use description2 format for hooty like in agaetr_send
Add image shrinker for alt text for hooty
preprocessor tested
pull in ---- 
* Check that send exits cleanly if there's no articles !!
test self_link output
           Hooty needs better control pathways in for determining what is on and not
Not using existing alt text when it's in the DB?
SCRIPT_DIR FOR SENDERS IS DIFFERENT -- FIX THAT AND HAVE IT NOT OVERWRITE THE VARIABLE
* ensure there's no "exit" calls in senders 
    if [ ${#link} -gt 36 ]; then 
        if [ -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/short_enabled/yourls.sh" ];then
            source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/yourls.sh"
            loud "Sending to shortener function"
            yourls_shortener
        fi

TUMBLR TEXT:  https://github.com/admacro/gotumblr
    pita, but hey.  Will need whole different output generator here.

# archive.is  -- add into readme
# swap wayback to waybackpy via pipx - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
#### incorporate adding these to the post
# archive.org - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
# archive.is -  https://github.com/palewire/archiveis
# removal of the short blurb

SO OUR FLOW WILL HAVE TO BE
- if archive.is,
    do first, capture url
- if internet archive
    do second, capture url
    (shorten that url)
single url 
holy crap, I've got duplicate functions, moron
# bespoke it.  Can't fix everyone's issue.
# toot
updated bsky
so need multiple toot configurations

toot auth -- lists them
toot activate selects them

or just tag -u [account] on the end.


remove configurators
