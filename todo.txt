# bsky - add configurator -- update
# archive.is  -- add into readme
# swap wayback to waybackpy via pipx - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
test add single url

# archive.org - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/

    do second, capture url
    (shorten that url)

# Something like a "daily urls" post?
# better tagging
# removal of the short blurb
# incorporate some ai summary shit? Maybe for image ID? Still, ew.
