bsky - add configurator -- update

there's something that breaks when the image is bogus that needs to be debugged too.

 
* incorporate some from newsbeuter-dangerzone
* test INBOUND wallabag - seems to be broken?
* Check that send exits cleanly if there's no articles !!
* Check parser doesn't choke if there's a newline at the end of the posts.db file
* If hashtags are in description or title, make first occurance a hashtag
* XMPP   OUT VIA BOT ?
# lemmy ?
# any other open server socials worth posting to?
# Something like a "daily urls" post?
# better tagging
# incorporate some ai summary shit? Maybe for image ID? Still, ew.

 

# TO TEST
test add single url
test using user level systemd instead of cron as better way to have environment
test self_link output






DONE
# archive.is  -- add into readme
# swap wayback to waybackpy via pipx - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
#### incorporate adding these to the post
# archive.org - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
# archive.is -  https://github.com/palewire/archiveis
# removal of the short blurb

SO OUR FLOW WILL HAVE TO BE
- if archive.is,
    do first, capture url
- if internet archive
    do second, capture url
    (shorten that url)
single url 
holy crap, I've got duplicate functions, moron
# bespoke it.  Can't fix everyone's issue.
