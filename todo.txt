Make up hooty to both replace patootie and also to test sending







there's something that breaks when the image is bogus that needs to be debugged too.

* Check that send exits cleanly if there's no articles !!
* Check parser doesn't choke if there's a newline at the end of the posts.db file

archiver outputs
all other outputs
test add single url 
test using user level systemd instead of cron as better way to have environment
test self_link output
test hooty
Add hashtag field to hooty

# DONE

Add image shrinker for alt text for hooty
preprocessor tested
pull in ---- 
           Hooty needs better control pathways in for determining what is on and not
Not using existing alt text when it's in the DB?
SCRIPT_DIR FOR SENDERS IS DIFFERENT -- FIX THAT AND HAVE IT NOT OVERWRITE THE VARIABLE
* ensure there's no "exit" calls in senders 
    if [ ${#link} -gt 36 ]; then 
        if [ -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/short_enabled/yourls.sh" ];then
            source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/yourls.sh"
            loud "Sending to shortener function"

    pita, but hey.  Will need whole different output generator here.

# archive.is  -- add into readme
# swap wayback to waybackpy via pipx - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
#### incorporate adding these to the post
# archive.org - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
# archive.is -  https://github.com/palewire/archiveis
# removal of the short blurb

SO OUR FLOW WILL HAVE TO BE
- if archive.is,
    do first, capture url
- if internet archive
    do second, capture url
    (shorten that url)
single url 
holy crap, I've got duplicate functions, moron
# bespoke it.  Can't fix everyone's issue.
# toot
updated bsky
so need multiple toot configurations

toot auth -- lists them
toot activate selects them

or just tag -u [account] on the end.


remove configurators
