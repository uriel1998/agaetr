Make up hooty to both replace patootie and also to test sending







there's something that breaks when the image is bogus that needs to be debugged too.


* incorporate some from newsbeuter-dangerzone
* test INBOUND wallabag - seems to be broken?
* Check that send exits cleanly if there's no articles !!
* Check parser doesn't choke if there's a newline at the end of the posts.db file
* If hashtags are in description or title, make first occurance a hashtag
* XMPP   OUT VIA BOT ?
# lemmy ? - refer folks to https://github.com/programming-dot-dev/rss-bot and use with
# the rss
# any other open server socials worth posting to?
# Something like a "daily urls" post?
# better tagging
# incorporate some ai summary shit? Maybe for image ID? Still, ew.

Add link field to hooty?
Add image shrinker for alt text for hooty

SCRIPT_DIR FOR SENDERS IS DIFFERENT -- FIX THAT AND HAVE IT NOT OVERWRITE THE VARIABLE
* ensure there's no "exit" calls in senders 
    if [ ${#link} -gt 36 ]; then 
        if [ -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/short_enabled/yourls.sh" ];then
            source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/yourls.sh"

    pita, but hey.  Will need whole different output generator here.

# archive.is  -- add into readme
# swap wayback to waybackpy via pipx - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
#### incorporate adding these to the post
# archive.org - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
# archive.is -  https://github.com/palewire/archiveis
# removal of the short blurb

SO OUR FLOW WILL HAVE TO BE
- if archive.is,
    do first, capture url
- if internet archive
    do second, capture url
    (shorten that url)
single url 
holy crap, I've got duplicate functions, moron
# bespoke it.  Can't fix everyone's issue.
# toot
updated bsky
so need multiple toot configurations

toot auth -- lists them
toot activate selects them

or just tag -u [account] on the end.


remove configurators
