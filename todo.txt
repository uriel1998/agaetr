# any other open server socials worth posting to?
# Something like a "daily urls" post?

# incorporate some ai summary shit? Maybe for image ID? Still, ew.


DONE
# swap wayback to waybackpy via pipx - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
#### incorporate adding these to the post
# archive.org - https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/
# archive.is -  https://github.com/palewire/archiveis
