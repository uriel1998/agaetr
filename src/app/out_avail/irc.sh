IRC is a simple text and line oriented protocol, so it can be done with the basic linux tools. So, without installing ii:

echo -e 'USER bot guest tolmoon tolsun\nNICK bot\nJOIN #channel\nPRIVMSG #channel :Ahoj lidi!\nQUIT\n' \
| nc irc.freenode.net 6667

In this command, nc does the network connection, and you send a login info, nick, join a channel named "#channel" amd send a message "Ahoj lidi!" to that channel. And quit the server.


    add \nQUIT at the end of the list of commands to quit right after sending the one message â€“
