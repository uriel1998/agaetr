                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 4 min<span class="c1"><strong>Xdotool - Keyboard</strong></span><p>The xdotool is a utility used from the terminal or in a script to manually perform keyboard input. The commands can also be used to make a script of many xdotool commands to perform large tasks. Later articles will cover the xdotool ability to perform mouse input as well as window and desktop manipulation.</p><p>The syntax for xdotool depends on the command being used. Let's start with sending keystrokes to a window by using the 'key' command. The syntax is as follows:</p><p><em>key [options] [keys]</em></p><p>There are three options available for the key command:</p><ol><li data-xf-list-type="ol"><em>--window window_id</em> – specified keys for the keystrokes are sent to the window_id application.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol"><em>--clearmodifiers</em> – all modifiers are cleared, such as CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, shift held down, a mouse button held down, etc.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol"><em>--delay milliseconds</em> – sets the delay between each keystroke being sent, the default is 12 ms.</li>
</ol><br />The [keys] specify which keys are being sent to the specified window. The keys are based on the X Keysym strings and are:<ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">exclam<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">quotedbl<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">numbersign<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">dollar<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">percent<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">ampersand<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">quoteright<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">parenleft<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">parenright<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">bracketleft<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">asterisk<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">backslash<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">bracketright<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">asciicircum<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">underscore<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">period<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">quoteleft<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">semicolon<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">greater<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">question<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">braceleft<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">braceright<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">asciitilde<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">ctrl (Control key)<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">alt (Alternate key)<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">BackSpace<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">F1-F12 (Function 1 key to Function 12 just use the number of the specific Function key)<br /></li>
</ul><ul><li data-xf-list-type="ul">Return (Return or Enter key)<br /></li>
</ul>Each of these characters can be used separately and some together. A space is placed between individual keystrokes and simultaneous keystrokes are connected with a plus (+) sign. For example, to perform a single keystroke of a space and then an 'x' would be: 'space x'. When simultaneous keys are pressed, such as CTRL and 'x', the keystroke would be: 'ctrl+x'. Another example would be to open a file in LibreOffice Writer. The keystrokes would be 'alt+f o', or even the shortcut key 'ctrl+o'.<p>Looking at the previous options for the key command, you may have noticed the –window option which requires the window id. You may wonder how you find the id of a specific window. Finding the id is a simple procedure which will be covered more in another article, but I can give the basics of it now since it is needed.</p><p>To find the window id of a specific window, use the following command:</p><p><em>xdotool search --name TITLE</em></p><p>“TITLE” is replaced with a part or all of the title of the window. When any application is opened, the title bar shows the window title. Use this name or part of it to determine the window id as shown in Figure 1.<br /></p><div class="c2"><div class="lbContainer lbContainer--inline" title="xDoTool - Keyboard Figure 1.jpg" data-xf-init="lightbox" data-lb-single-image="1" data-lb-container-zoom="1" data-lb-trigger=".js-lbImage-attachment1826" data-lb-id="attachment1826"><img src="https://www.linux.org/attachments/xdotool-keyboard-figure-1-jpg.1826/" data-url="" class="bbImage" data-zoom-target="1" alt="xDoTool - Keyboard Figure 1.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></div><br /><strong>FIGURE 1</strong>​</div><br />You can see I did a search for 'google'. I could have searched for any word of the title name of 'google mozilla firefox'. I received only one response of “52428942” since there is only one match for the title name of 'google' on the system.<p>Now, let us assume I wanted to do something easy, to shutdown Firefox with the xdotool command. To close Firefox, I need to send it the keystroke of alt+f to open the File menu, then a 'Q' to select Quit. The command would be:</p><p><em>xdotool key --window 52428942 alt+f Q</em></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you enter everything correctly and your system supports xdotool, then Firefox should close. If you have multiple tabs opened there should be a message box appears to ask to close all tabs.</p><p>The next command is the 'keydown' command. The keydown produces the effect of holding down a key on the keyboard. The key will remain pressed until you press CTRL+C.</p><p>The syntax is:</p><p><em>keydown [options] [key]</em></p><p>The options are the same as the “key” command. The following command would produce an effect in the current window to have the letter 'J' held down on the keyboard.</p><p><em>xdotool keydown J</em></p><p>The letter “J” will repeat continuously until you press CTRL+C.</p><p>Another command is the 'keyup' command to stop the keydown. The options are the same as key and keydown commands. The following command will allow the letter 'J' to be held down, and then the key is released with the keyup command after a delay of 500 ms:</p><p><em>xdotool keydown J; xdotol keyup --delay 500 J</em></p><p>Multiple commands can be placed on a single line separated by a semicolon (<img src="denied:data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink ;)" data-shortname=";)" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />.</p><p>Another way to chain commands is to place multiple xdotool commands only separated by a space as follows:</p><p><em>xdotool keydown J keyup --delay 500 J</em></p><p>The last keyboard command for xdotool is 'type'. The syntax is as follows:</p><p><em>type [options] [string]</em></p><p>The options are the same as the other commands for the keyboard and work the same way.</p><p>For instance, to type a string into the Firefox application in the currently selected box, perform the following:</p><p><em>xdotool type --window 46137486 <a href="https://www.linux.org" class="link link--internal">www.linux.org</a></em></p><p>The window id for Firefox is 46137486. If the current selected input box is the search box for Google, then '<a href="https://www.linux.org" class="link link--internal">www.linux.org</a>' would be typed in the search box. If the current input is the address box, then '<a href="https://www.linux.org" class="link link--internal">www.linux.org</a>' would be in the address box.</p><p>If the address box is selected as the current input box, then you could have it automatically put in '<a href="https://www.linux.org" class="link link--internal">www.linux.org</a>' as follows:</p><p><em>xdotool type --window 46137486 <a href="https://www.linux.org" class="link link--internal">www.linux.org</a></em></p><p>All characters after type are accepted as the string to type. No other commands can be placed after type.</p><p>Practice on the keyboard commands and I will cover the mouse commands next time.</p>]]>

These hot, dry years were followed by the extremely wet winter of 2016 -2017, when, from October to March, an average of 31 inches of rain fell across the state, the second highest winter rainfall on record.</p><p>All that rain meant a bumper crop of grasses and other vegetation, which, as hot and dry conditions returned, likely contributed to a combustible mix of fuels that played a role in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/californias-wildfires-are-the-doom-of-our-own-making/">severe fires</a> that have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/kincade-fire/">swept California</a> in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-california-needs-to-adapt-to-survive-future-fires/">past two years</a>.</p><p>These wild swings from one weather extreme to another are symptomatic of a phenomenon, variously known as “climate whiplash” or “weather whiplash,” that scientists say is likely to increase as the world warms. The intensity of wildfires these days in places like California are a symptom of climate change, experts say, but the whiplash effect poses a different set of problems for humans and natural systems. Researchers project that by the end of this century, the frequency of these abrupt transitions between wet and dry will increase by 25 percent in Northern California and as much as double in Southern California if greenhouse gasses continue to increase.</p><p>“There has been an assumption that the main thing we have to contend with climate change is increased temperatures, decreased snowpack, increased wildfire risk” on the West Coast, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Those things are still true, but there is this other dimension we will have to contend with — the increased risk of extreme flood and drought, and rapid transitions between the two.”</p><p>Last year in Montecito, California, one of the state’s worst wildfires swept through the region. Weeks later, torrential rains fell on the burned ground, causing mudslides <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/post-wildfire-mudslide/">that wiped out houses and killed 21 people</a>. In Europe this year, late spring frosts that damaged crops were followed by heavy rains that washed the crops out of the ground and flooded fields for weeks.</p><p>In the future, weather whiplash could mean an intense drought year followed by record rains that don’t allow planting or that wash fertilizer into waterways. Extreme swings between freezing and thawing can kill buds on trees, or lead to rain in northerly climes that is followed by freezing weather, forming a barrier of ice that prevents foraging animals like caribou from reaching vital winter browse.</p><p>Tree ring data shows a significant increase in climate volatility in the last 60 years in Europe. The North Atlantic Jet Stream fluctuates between the Balkans to the south and Scotland to the north. Some 300 years of tree ring samples taken in both places show that the jet stream has become far more variable in the last six decades and more extreme in its positions, which results in more severe climate events and a more rapid shifting between extremes on yearly, monthly, and weekly timescales.</p><p>“The timing of the changes suggests that it’s anthropogenic,” said Valerie Trouet, who studies climate at the University of Arizona’s Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research.</p><p>Experts say one cause of climate whiplash may be warming-related disruptions in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/polar-vortex-chicago-flights-cancelled-cold-why/">the polar vortex</a>, which in turn affects <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/jet&quot;}" href="https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/jet" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the jet stream</a>. The vortex is a wall of wind that constantly circles the Arctic and prevents warm air from penetrating the cold regions, and cold air from moving south. When it is stable, the polar vortex produces normal, seasonal weather. But an unstable polar vortex causes abnormal and extreme weather.</p>]]>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 6 min<p>The marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made me a romantic again, but love is not always roses and tiaras. My partner recently went through a crisis where his wife withdrew her consent for our relationship a year and a half into our relationship. She felt that our relationship was a threat to their marriage and that he could not love her in the way she wanted if he continued his relationship with me. After struggling for more than a year, he decided that it was too much for him to fight with her every day and he needed to prioritize his family, so he withdrew from our relationship. As much as he tried to maintain our relationship, in the end, there was no way he could satisfy her and me, so he chose the path of less resistance. I wrote this “manifesto” in response to what I saw as a not ethical or loving way to deal with conflict in a poly relationship. If anyone is wondering what to do when a partner tries to control your relationships, or if your partner tries to force you into opening your relationship, I hope this helps to clarify the ethical framework.</p>
<p><strong>1. No one has a right to tell you who you can have a romantic relationship with, or how.</strong> As late as 1967, it was illegal in many parts of the US for a white person to marry a person of color, and as late as 2014, it was illegal to marry someone of the same sex. Today these laws are regarded as bigoted and unethical. The right to marry your chosen partner regardless of their gender, race, or religion is considered fundamental and belonging to everyone. Exceptions still apply to cases like minors and blood relatives, but even those are being challenged.</p>
<p><strong>2. Your family and friends do not have the right to control your relationships.</strong> People you already have relationships with do not have the right to tell you with whom and how to have your romantic relationships. Parents may have strong preferences about who they want their children to be partnered with, and sometimes children decide to abide by those preferences because they do not wish to alienate their parents, but in Western, developed countries, parents don’t make that decision for their children. Children also sometimes have preferences about who you are in a relationship with, but they do make decisions about partners for their parents. Parents can and often do help their children adjust to partners they object to, but ultimately parents make the decision. Friends and other less intimate relationships have even less right to interfere.</p>
<p><strong>3. An exception is your spouse, because you mutually agreed to forsake other partners when you got married,</strong> and that agreement is enforced with a legal contract. Should you breach that agreement, your partner has the right to invoke divorce and bring legal and social ramifications upon you.</p>
<p><strong>4. However, agreements can be altered if they no longer serve the individuals involved</strong>. Agreements are written to serve the people involved, and they sometimes need to be updated in order to address new circumstances. Marriage contracts by default stipulate monogamy, and changing that requires explicit consent from both partners. Some couples agree to alter the wedding vows, and some couples decide to change their agreement after the marriage through discussion, or after an infidelity.</p>
<p><strong>5. Changes to agreements need to be consented to by all parties involved.</strong> When someone decides to change an agreement, drastically alter it, or terminate it all together, they must raise the changes to the other parties involved, and the other parties need to consent in order for the agreement to be valid. If two people in a business partnership agree that they have equal say in decisions about their business, one person cannot decide that he will make major decisions for the other, without the other’s consent. A tenant cannot stop paying rent without the landlord’s consent. It sometimes happens that one person decides to renege on an agreement, and if the agreement has legal force, then the agreement holder can bring legal action against the agreement neglector and force them to uphold the agreement. An alteration to an agreement that has not been consented to by all parties is not valid.</p>
<p><strong>6. Manipulating a partner into giving consent is not ethical.</strong> If the person who wants to changes the agreement cannot get the other person’s willing consent, they may resort to tactics to wear down their partner’s resistance. Tactics could include 1) making them feel guilty about things their partner has done, 2) gaslighting them into thinking that the agreement was something other than what was agreed to, 3) withholding benefits from their relationship, or threatening to withhold those benefits, 4) using their children, finances, possessions, or their reputation as tools of extortion, 5) Resorting to physical, emotional, or psychological abuse, 6) Generally making their life difficult or unpleasant. Through these means, the person may eventually obtain consent from the other person. Consent obtained under duress is not consent, and using tactics to obtain someone’s consent this way is manipulative, unethical, and not loving.</p>
<p><strong>7. If one person stops upholding an agreement, the other parties involved are not obligated to uphold the agreement.</strong> If a business partner starts doing business in a way that is not agreed to by the other partner, then the other partner has the right to terminate that business partner. If a renter stops paying rent, then the landlord has the right to evict the tenant. In a romantic relationship, when one person stops being loving to their partner, then the partner is not obligated to continue being loving to them at his own expense. They may still feel love for that person, and try to talk them into upholding their agreement or come up with a new agreement, but they are not obligated to provide the deliverables in their agreement if the partner has ceased to provide theirs. Of course, people go through illness, depression, disability, stress, or other hardships that make it difficult or impossible for them to do their part in a relationship for a while, however, those cases can be differentiated from ones where the partner is simply uninterested, unwilling, or incapable of upholding their obligations in a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>8. Love does not mean that you have to uphold an agreement that is no longer valid.</strong> Love is 1) not harming the one you love, 2) Supporting their personal growth, even if sometimes that means causing them pain and inconvenience, 3) Respecting their freedom and autonomy, even if you do not agree with their choices. Love is not 1) changing your values for the other person, 2) causing yourself harm, 3) restricting your autonomy to a degree that it causes you unhappiness. If someone loves you, they should not be intentionally causing you harm, restricting your growth, or suppressing your freedom. If they are doing that then you have every right to let them know what they are doing and demand that they stop.</p>
<p><strong>9. All needs are not equal.</strong> People have different needs in relationships and compromises are sometimes necessary to meet them. However, needs are not all equal, and just because someone has a need, does not mean that one should sacrifice her own needs to satisfy another’s. For example, one partner’s need to work will sometimes supersede the other partner’s need for fun. A need to maintain relationships that are important to one partner may supersede the partner’s need to not be inconvenienced. A need for sexual freedom may not supersede the other partner’s need to feel safe physically and sexually. The importance of each need is relative compared to the needs that are compromised to meet it.</p>
<p>If we think about a relationship as an agreement, the way a business relationship is an agreement, then it becomes clear what can and cannot be done. When an agreement is disregarded, altered, or terminated without discussion or consent, it is a breach of contract and an ethical failure. Just because one is in a romantic relationship or married does not excuse someone from behaving unethically and abusively.</p>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 12 min<p>He was married, nineteen years older, and my supervisor at the start-up he founded. We “met” when I published a blog article about Findhorn, and he emailed to tell me that he liked it. This led to a year-long conversation about ecovillages, sustainability, relationships, and working on a start-up together. Then one summer evening, he was in town visiting his mother. I met him for dinner, and as we talked about our work and relationships over spicy salmon rolls, it felt like reuniting with a long lost family member, a father I hadn’t seen since childhood perhaps, or a twin brother separated at birth. We talked until midnight on the porch under the magnolia tree. The next day I wandered about in a daze, recalling his hands on my face, the audacity of his lips on mine. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, and when I tried to describe to my best friend what happened, I was as astonished as she was to hear myself say, “I met Art in person for the first time last night. I love him.”</p>
<p>He had been in an open marriage for 25 years. When he and his wife lived at Findhorn in the 1990’s, she fell in love with someone in the community, and after six months of talking about it, they decided to open their relationship rather than call it quits. At the time, several affairs came to light in the community, heartbroken couples split up, and people left the community. Years later, he recalls how their agreement kept their marriage intact. “I am sure that we would not be together today if we had not opened our relationship,” he said.</p>
<p>I discovered polyamory a few years before I met him after reading “Sex at Dawn,” and then verifying on the internet that it was a thing. My discovery that there was a way to ethically be in more than one romantic relationship at a time was as liberating to me as accepting that I wasn’t going to hell for having sex with my boyfriend when I was twenty. There was nothing wrong with me for loving more than one person at a time. In fact, it felt like a gift that I loved with so little jealousy and so much generosity.</p>
<p>In December I visited him and his family. He and I slept in the guest bedroom while his wife slept in their bedroom. The next morning she made eggs, toast and coffee for breakfast. Their daughters, age 11 and 15, acted as if it was perfectly normal for their dad’s girlfriend to sit down at breakfast with their parents. They left to visit her family for the holidays leaving us to spend a blissful seven days alone together. On New Year’s Day they came back with her boyfriend, John. We all unwrapped presents, and I took photos of us: Guin smiling goofily as her husband and her boyfriend leaned in to kiss her cheeks, Art with one arm around his wife and the other arm around me.</p>
<p>By March, we were talking about moving in together. Having lived in intentional communities for over 25 years, Art was no stranger to the pitfalls entailed, but this was different, because the people involved were in intimate relationships with each other. We would be sharing our beds as well as our home, our partners and our families. How would we split the finances, make sure the house was clean, and dietary differences accomodated? Who would sleep where, when? How would we make decisions and deal with conflicts? There was a lot to figure out, but with everyone being a mature adult and Art and Guin’s experience living in communities, we were excited to try to figure it out.</p>
<p>In September, I packed everything that could fit into my four-door sedan, including my dog, and drove the ten hours to our new home halfway across the country. Art and Guin had found a huge house in the suburbs with six bedrooms, a hot tub, and fenced back yard. It was bigger than anything any of us had lived in, and big enough, we hoped, to contain all of our relationships and all of our dreams.</p>
<p>The first month went fairly well. Guin and John were on vacation at Findhorn, Art and I painted rooms, bought furniture, and confused the neighbors about our relationship (are you the daughter? The wife? What are you?). But once Guin came back and John went home, problems started. She complained that I woke her up when I walked around my room in the morning, that I stacked my shoes incorrectly by the door, and left my mug out on the table after breakfast. She wanted a cat, even though I am allergic to cats. She didn’t bother to tell me that she would be late at work and wouldn’t be able to make dinner. Her back hurt and she wanted to sleep in the master bedroom, even though it was Art’s room and we were supposed to take turns being in it with him. Since I was the new person, I tried to please her and brush off the injustices, even though I knew it was setting a bad precedent.</p>
<p>In October came bad news: John was not moving in with us. He had started a new relationship with a woman back home, and even though he loved Guin, it was no longer working for him to be partnered with a married woman.</p>
<p>Guin was devastated. Ironically, she had encouraged John to pursue this new love interest, thinking that it would help him understand polyamory, but he chose monogamy instead. She cried inconsolably, lamenting the loss of “the love of her life.” She complained bitterly that Art never paid attention to her like John did, and now that he was gone, there was nobody to love her. While I was visiting my parents for the holidays, she flew into a rage when she found him talking on the phone with me, and it took him hours to calm her down. She said she was polyamorous all those years only because of the lack of intimacy n her marriage. She demanded that her husband and I break up so they could work on their marriage.</p>
<p>After recovering from his shock, Art refused. Not only did he not want to break up with me, he felt that her demand was unethical given their agreements.</p>
<p>“If we had two children,” he asked, “and the child that you liked better died, would you give away the other child?”</p>
<p>“Well yeah,” she answered unsympathetically.</p>
<p>“Wrong answer.” He told her.</p>
<p>I found an apartment on the other side of town and we continued our relationship as best as we could with him coming to see me twice a week. His family life was increasingly unbearable. They no longer slept together, and she was angry all the time and they fought whenever he tried to talk to her about our relationship. Every time he came to my place, he arrived shaken from the fight he just had with her, and I spent hours trying to comfort him, counsel him, and imploring him to make some hard decisions.</p>
<p>“I am ready to commit everything, Art,” I said with tears in my eyes, “Are you?”</p>
<p>He was silent. He wasn’t ready to give up on thirty years of marriage. He wanted to be with his children and for them to be with their mother, and he wasn’t ready to turn his life upside down. If only they could talk with a therapist, work out their resentments or their sexual hangups, or even try Ayuhuasca (a psychedelic drug), then perhaps she would understand and accept our relationship. “I don’t want to give up until I have tried everything,” he said.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It’s been almost two years since Art went home to his wife and didn’t come back. He tried valiantly to stay in touch with me, braving many fights and abuses in order to see and talk to me.  We tried a six month break where we did not have sexual contact and saw each other rarely, and I spent six months living in a different state where we did not see each other at all. She continued to berate him about talking to me, so we went two months without talking to each other. They went to therapy and worked with two poly-friendly counselors, but could find no compromise that would make both of them happy. She insisted that monogamy was what she needed to stay in the marriage, and he said he needed autonomy to have a relationship with me. But when the reality comes down to defying his wife and living in a disharmonious household, he chose to stay home.</p>
<p>It’s taken me almost as long to recover from the depression that ensued. I suffered frequent migraines, chronic back pain, heart palpitations, and suicidal thoughts. My weight dropped from 116 to 102 pounds. I have had bad breakups before, but nothing this soul-crushing. With yoga, therapy, and a lot of help from my dog, I slowly, slowly, brought myself back to life. In the process, I developed some insights to help me move forward.</p>
<p>I learned that trying to convince someone to do something they don’t want is like leading a calf to slaughter: the more you pull, the harder they pull away. I would love for Art and Guin to love each other and to love me, but I can’t make that happen. Even though I’ve talked to Art many times, I cannot convince him to act differently. Accepting that people are not going to change was the biggest part of my letting go. All I could do was focus on getting myself better, which I did by dating, going to the gym, and trying to eat as much as possible.  </p>
<p>I accepted that sometimes good people do stupid things, and that’s just a fact of life. I don’t understand why people shoot children in schools, why our government doesn’t take action on climate change, or why Trump was elected President. Volumes have been written on why things are the way they are, but the world is still a mess and I’m still disappointing to my mom. Even Buddha or Christ probably broke someone’s heart at some point in their lives. Understanding why Art made the choices he did helped me have compassion and forgiveness, but I still suffered the consequences of those decisions. I cannot prevent bad things from happening to good people, including myself, but if I were to be frustrated with everything I didn’t understand or like, I would explode and not be able to function. “Why me?” is not a productive question, shit happens, and we just have to do the best we can.</p>
<p>The most helpful lesson was that even if my beloved stops loving me, I don’t have to stop loving him. Just like if someone you love died suddenly, you’d continue to love them and remember them, even if they can’t love you back. Love is too strong an instinct to be dismissed, repressed, or restricted, even if it is not returned. If Art doesn’t come to see me, I can still text, “Good morning.” If he doesn’t talk to me, I can talk to him in my head. I can build a shrine or light a candle, and find some expression for my emotions, even if he’s not able to receive it. I can hold my partner a little longer, or take my dog for a longer walk, or call some friends and care about how they are doing, instead of always bemoaning how terrible things are for me. As the Rolling Stones sang, “You can’t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you get what you need.”</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, I am at the source of my love. I can generate it, give it, and attract it, regardless of whether I get it back. In fact, people do this all the time. Babies are born and loved even though we still don’t have universal health insurance, people work even though wages suck, and activists keep acting up even though the coming global warming apocalypse shows no sign of abating. Love is a rose blooming in December. Love is a smiling baby in poopy diapers.</p>
<p>Eventually I found a new partner, and we moved in together after nine months of dating. He is polyamorous and we truly support each other and our relationships with other partners. Sometimes I wake up in the morning next to him, and I cry about everything–the loss of my soulmate, the best sex I ever had, the home I wanted with him and longed for all my life. My partner holds me tightly in his arms and his shirt becomes wet with tears. Then I cry that in spite of everything, I love someone who loves me, someone whose beauty and kindness brought me back to life. I’m moved to tears by the simplest things—the smell of his hair, the warmth of his hand, his quiet and constant devotion.</p>
<p>I learned that relationships work not because they are polyamorous or monogamous, but because of the kindness and dedication of the people involved. I learned that intimacy doesn’t depend on how much sex you have or how much time you spend together, but mutual understanding and compassion. A couple who sleeps in the same bed and lives under the same roof can have no intimacy, while two people hundreds of miles apart interacting only through their phones can feel that their hearts are one. Love is more hardy than it is delicate, like a cactus.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can’t believe how lucky I am, the world seems so full of love, my heart can hardly stand it. It’s the 31st of December, and I’m dancing with friends at a New Year’s Eve party at their house. As we count the seconds to midnight under a swirling disco ball, I feel myself part of a community–people who show up to wish you happy New Year, people who spill champagne on your couch by accident, who call you when you are having a bad day, or when they get their heart broken. We don’t have to live in the same house to be a community, community is anyone who cares. Love is all around us, and all we have to do let it in.</p>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 7 min<p><em>Digital assets are becoming as important as physical assets, so how do you manage them after you die?</em></p><p>When you lose a member of your family, you may find yourself at some point thinking about your own mortality, which then may lead you to think through preparations for your own death. I lost my father recently, but years before his death, he set up a will that described how to manage his estate, but he also made sure to share with me login details for his important financial accounts so I would have access when the time came. When the time did come to put his plans into practice, those details were invaluable.</p><p>All of this made me realize just how complicated it would be for someone to manage my own accounts in the event of my death, especially considering how much effort I've gone through to secure my computers and accounts. After all, unlike my dad, I don't use the same password for everything. What I realized I needed was the equivalent of a digital will: instructions and credentials so my next of kin had everything they needed to access my accounts and manage my affairs. In this first article of what will be a two-part series, I describe the requirements and plans to create a digital will in a way that would be manageable for my next of kin while also not negatively affecting the security of my accounts. The second part of the article will describe how I implemented these plans.</p><h3>Defining Terms</h3><p>This digital will is based on many of the ideas behind a traditional will, and I intend on borrowing a lot of the framework and terms instead of "re-inventing the will". To get started, let me define a few terms, but I should make it clear that I'm not an attorney, so these are just loose definitions to describe how some common terms used in a will might be applied to this digital will:</p><ul><li><strong>Decedent/Testator:</strong> the decedent is the person who has died, and the testator is the person who signs the will and whose will it is. For our purposes, this will be the same person—the person who currently controls these digital assets that will be transferred upon his or her death.</li>
<li><strong>Beneficiary/Inheritor:</strong> the person or persons who are receiving a gift of personal property from the decedent. For our purposes, this is the person or persons who will get control of digital accounts or other assets.</li>
<li><strong>Administrator/Executor:</strong> the person who is to oversee the administration of the estate and make sure the will is followed according to the testator's wishes. Often a testator will name a preferred executor in the will itself; other times, they are appointed by the court. In the case of a traditional will, the executor also may happen to be a beneficiary, but for some larger or more complicated estates it's often a third party selected for their financial or business know-how. For our purposes here, the executor will need technical know-how and will be the person who assists the beneficiary with getting access to accounts and managing any digital assets up to the point that the beneficiary can take over and will no longer need technical assistance.</li>
</ul><h3>Goals and Requirements</h3><p>Unlike a traditional will, this digital will does <em>not</em> have a goal of defining who <em>gets</em> digital assets like online financial accounts—a traditional will already can define that sort of thing in an appropriate and legal way. Instead, the main goal of this digital will is to enable the executor to grant the beneficiary access to digital assets left behind. This main goal then helps with defining some related requirements.</p><p><strong>Requirement 1: Simplicity</strong></p><p>Dealing with a loved one's death and regular estate is difficult enough as it is. The extra complexity behind digital assets makes this even more difficult, and since you'll want to add security requirements on top, this very easily could result in a complicated and hard-to-follow process. Simplicity has to be a primary requirement, since you won't be around to help with the administration. This means however tempting it might be to use sophisticated cryptography algorithms or technologies, you need to make the digital will as foolproof and simple as possible.</p><p><strong>Requirement 2: Documentation</strong></p><p>Since I work in technology, I set up and maintain a number of systems at home. These include common household systems like wireless access points, a local file server and media center computers. Those systems are pretty common for people who are into computers, but as I have a sysadmin background, I also maintain email, web and DNS servers for domains that we own and that I and my family use for our main email and various blogs and other websites. All of these systems are largely undocumented, since I am the one who set them up and no one else maintains them, but obviously, that presents a problem if I die.</p><p>So one requirement for this project is to provide some kind of documentation for all of those systems. This documentation is not just about which systems exist (which is an important start), but it's also some level of detail on how to maintain those systems. The executor is the technical help here, but they can't be expected to perform their duties indefinitely. So the documentation also might need to cover how to migrate to a replacement system in the future, since some systems need more technical know-how to maintain long-term than the beneficiary may have. The person writing the digital will is in the best place to make those determinations, as they know the skill levels and time commitment necessary to maintain the systems as well as the skill levels and free time available to both the executor and the beneficiary.</p><p><strong>Requirement 3: Secure Transfer of Account Authentication</strong></p><p>Whether you maintain local IT systems in your house or not, you still likely have a number of online accounts that you don't share with anyone else. Each of those accounts has its own set of credentials, and although some online services have support in place so that a beneficiary or next of kin can take over the decedent's account with a valid death certificate, many don't.</p><p>The digital will needs to provide a way to transfer access to those accounts over to the beneficiary, possibly with the help of the executor, without putting those accounts at risk from outside attackers. Ideally, the accounts would sit in a kind of digital trust so that the executor can't independently get access to those accounts prematurely—no matter how much you trust your executor, you probably don't want that person to have access to all your accounts and systems while you are alive. In some circumstances, you also might choose to prevent the beneficiary from getting premature access as well (for instance, if the beneficiary is your child). Even if you <em>do</em> trust your executor and beneficiary fully, you may not trust your full set of secrets on their systems since they could get hacked.</p><p><strong>Requirement 4: Maintenance</strong></p><p>If you ever have been responsible for technical documentation, you know how quickly that sort of thing can become out of date. This digital will process is no different, but it's even more important that it be kept up to date. This means you need to add an additional requirement that you build in some process to keep the documentation, credentials and everything else related to this digital will up to date via some periodic process.</p><p><strong>Requirement 5: Fault Tolerance</strong></p><p>Technology and people can fail, so this digital will needs to account for and be resilient to failure both in any technology it picks and mistakes or memory lapses for any people involved. Systems should be redundant and account for failures and mistakes. You should be careful when choosing any solutions that rely on third parties that could go out of business or shut down a particular service they provide.</p><p><strong>Requirement 6: FOSS</strong></p><p>The technologies for this digital will should rely on free and open-source software (FOSS) not just because that matches my own ideals (and the ideals of <em>Linux Journal</em>), but also because a FOSS solution helps with the fault-tolerance requirement. FOSS software, even if it becomes unmaintained, still should be available for use in the future, whereas proprietary software or services may not.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Thinking through these requirements was hard, but not nearly as hard as figuring out an implementation that satisfies these requirements! In the next part of this article series, I will describe the solution I came up with for my own digital will.</p>]]>

You can use Bash’s job control functions and signals to give you more flexibility in how you run commands. We show you how.</p><h2>All About Processes</h2>
<p>Whenever a program is executed in a Linux or Unix-like operating system, a process is started. “Process” is the name for the internal representation of the executing program in the computer’s memory.  There is a process for every active program. In fact, there is a process for nearly everything that is running on your computer. That includes the components of your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment">graphical desktop environment</a> (GDE) such as <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> or <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a>, and system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">daemons</a> that are launched at start-up.</p>
<p>Why <em>nearly</em> everything that is running? Well, Bash built-ins such as <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html">cd</a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pwd.1.html">pwd</a>, and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/alias.1p.html">alias</a> do not need to have a process launched (or “spawned”) when they are run. Bash executes these commands within the instance of the Bash shell that is running in your terminal window. These commands are fast precisely because they don’t need to have a process launched for them to execute. (You can type <code>help</code> in a terminal window to see the list of Bash built-ins.)</p>
<p>Processes can be running in the foreground, in which case they take over your terminal until they have completed, or they can be run in the background. Processes that run in the background don’t dominate the terminal window and you can continue to work in it. Or at least, they don’t dominate the terminal window if they don’t generate screen output.</p>
<h2>A Messy Example</h2>
<p>We’ll start a simple <code>ping</code> <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ping.8.html">trace running</a>. We’re going to <code>ping</code> the How-To Geek domain. This will execute as a foreground process.</p>
<pre>ping www.howtogeek.com</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441052" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-10.png" alt="ping www.howtogeek.com in a terminal window" width="646" height="57" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>We get the expected results, scrolling down the terminal window. We can’t do anything else in the terminal window while <code>ping</code> is running. To terminate the command hit <code>Ctrl+C</code>.</p>
<pre>Ctrl+C</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441053" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-9.png" alt="ping trace output in a terminal window" width="646" height="352" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>The visible effect of the <code>Ctrl+C</code> is highlighted in the screenshot. <code>ping</code> gives a short summary and then stops.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat that. But this time we’ll hit <code>Ctrl+Z</code> instead of <code>Ctrl+C</code>. The task won’t be terminated. It will become a background task. We get control of the terminal window returned to us.</p>
<pre>ping www.howtogeek.com</pre>
<pre>Ctrl+Z</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441054" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3-10.png" alt="effect of Ctrl+Z on a command running in a terminal window" width="646" height="307" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>The visible effect of hitting <code>Ctrl+Z</code> is highlighted in the screenshot.</p>
<p>This time we are told the process is stopped. Stopped doesn’t mean terminated. It’s like a car at a stop sign. We haven’t scrapped it and thrown it away. It’s still on the road, stationary, waiting to go. The process is now a background <em>job</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>jobs</code> command <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/jobs.1p.html">will list the jobs</a> that have been started in the current terminal session. And because jobs are (inevitably) processes, we can also use the <code>ps</code> command to see them. Let’s use both commands and compare their outputs. We’ll use the <code>T</code> option (terminal) option to only list the processes that are running in this terminal window. Note that there is no need to use a hyphen <code>-</code> with the <code>T</code> option.</p>
<pre>jobs</pre>
<pre>ps T</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441056" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-5.png" alt="jobs command in a terminal window" width="646" height="197" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>The <code>jobs</code> command tells us:</p>
<ul><li><strong>[1]</strong>: The number in square brackets is the job number. We can use this to refer to the job when we need to control it with job control commands.</li>
<li><strong>+</strong>: The plus sign <code>+</code> shows that this is the job that will be acted upon if we use a job control command without a specific job number. It is called the default job. The default job is always the one most recently added to the list of jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped</strong>: The process is not running.</li>
<li><strong>ping www.howtogeek.com</strong>: The command line that launched the process.</li>
</ul><p>The <code>ps</code> command tells us:</p>
<ul><li><strong>PID</strong>: The process ID of the process. Each process has a unique ID.</li>
<li><strong>TTY</strong>: The pseudo-teletype (terminal window) that the process was executed from.</li>
<li><strong>STAT</strong>: The status of the process.</li>
<li><strong>TIME</strong>: The amount of CPU time consumed by the process.</li>
<li><strong>COMMAND</strong>: The command that launched the process.</li>
</ul><p>These are common values for the STAT column:</p>
<ul><li><strong>D</strong>: Uninterruptible sleep. The process is in a waiting state, usually waiting for input or output, and cannot be interrupted.</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>: Idle.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>: Running.</li>
<li><strong>S</strong>: Interruptible sleep.</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>: Stopped by a job control signal.</li>
<li><strong>Z</strong>: A zombie process. The process has been terminated but hasn’t been “cleaned down” by its parent process.</li>
</ul><p>The value in the STAT column can be followed by one of these extra indicators:</p>
<ul><li><strong>&lt;</strong>: High-priority task (not nice to other processes).</li>
<li><strong>N</strong>: Low-priority (nice to other processes).</li>
<li><strong>L</strong>: process has pages locked into memory (typically used by real-time processes).</li>
<li><strong>s</strong>: A session leader. A session leader is a process that has launched process groups. A shell is a session leader.</li>
<li><strong>l</strong>: Multi-thread process.</li>
<li><strong>+</strong>: A foreground process.</li>
</ul><p>We can see that Bash has a state of <code>Ss</code>. The uppercase “S” tell us the Bash shell is sleeping, and it is interruptible. As soon as we need it, it will respond.  The lowercase “s” tells us that the shell is a session leader.</p>
<p>The ping command has a state of <code>T</code>. This tells us that <code>ping</code> has been stopped by a job control signal. In this example, that was the <code>Ctrl+Z</code> we used to put it into the background.</p>
<p>The <code>ps T</code> command has a state of <code>R</code>, which stands for running. The <code>+</code> indicates that this process is a member of the foreground group. So the <code>ps T</code> command is running in the foreground.</p>
<h2>The bg Command</h2>
<p>The <code>bg</code> command is used to resume a background process. It can be used with or without a job number. If you use it without a job number the default job is brought to the foreground. The process still runs in the background. You cannot send any input to it.</p>
<p>If we issue the <code>bg</code> command, we will resume our <code>ping</code> command:</p>
<pre>bg</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441126" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5-5.png" alt="bg in a terminal window" width="646" height="57" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>The <code>ping</code> command resumes and we see the scrolling output in the terminal window once more. The name of the command that has been restarted is displayed for you. This is highlighted in the screenshot.</p>

<p>But we have a problem. The task is running in the background and won’t accept input. So how do we stop it? <code>Ctrl+C</code> doesn’t do anything. We can see it when we type it but the background task doesn’t receive those keystrokes so it keeps pinging merrily away.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441138" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/7-5.png" alt="Background task ignoring Ctrl+C in a terminal window" width="646" height="382" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>In fact, we’re now in a strange blended mode. We can type in the terminal window but what we type is quickly swept away by the scrolling output from the <code>ping</code> command. Anything we type takes effect in the foregound.</p>
<p>To stop our background task we need to bring it to the foreground and then stop it.</p>
<h2>The fg Command</h2>
<p>The <code>fg</code> command will bring a background task into the foreground. Just like the <code>bg</code> command, it can be used with or without a job number. Using it with a job number means it will operate on a specific job. If it is used without a job number the last command that was sent to the background is used.</p>
<p>If we type <code>fg</code> our <code>ping</code> command will be brought to the foreground. The characters we type are mixed up with the output from the <code>ping</code> command, but they are operated on by the shell as if they had been entered on the command line as usual. And in fact, from the Bash shell’s point of view, that is exactly what has happened.</p>
<pre>fg</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441142" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8-6.png" alt="fg command mixed in with the output from ping in a terminal window" width="646" height="382" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>And now that we have the <code>ping</code> command running in the foreground once more, we can use <code>Ctrl+C</code> to kill it.</p>
<pre>Ctrl+C</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441143" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9-4.png" alt="Ctrl+C stopping the ping command in a terminal window" width="646" height="382" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<h2>We Need to Send the Right Signals</h2>
<p>That wasn’t exactly pretty. Evidently running a process in the background works best when the process doesn’t produce output and doesn’t require input.</p>
<p>But, messy or not, our example did accomplish:</p>
<ul><li>Putting a process into the background.</li>
<li>Restoring the process to a running state in the background.</li>
<li>Returning the process to the foreground.</li>
<li>Terminating the process.</li>
</ul><p>When you use <code>Ctrl+C</code> and <code>Ctrl+Z</code> , you are sending signals to the process. These are <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html">shorthand ways</a> of using the <code>kill</code> command. There are <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html">64 different signals</a> that <code>kill</code> can send. Use <code>kill -l</code> at the command line to list them. <code>kill</code> isn’t the only source of these signals. Some of them are raised automatically by other processes within the system</p>
<p>Here are some of the commonly used ones.</p>
<ul><li><strong>SIGHUP</strong>: Signal 1. Automatically sent to a process when the terminal it is running in is closed.</li>
<li><strong>SIGINT</strong>: Signal 2. Sent to a process you hit <code>Ctrl+C</code>. The process is interrupted and told to terminate.</li>
<li><strong>SIGQUIT</strong>: Signal 3. Sent to a process if the user sends a quit signal <code>Ctrl+D</code>.</li>
<li><strong>SIGKILL</strong>: Signal 9. The process is immediately killed and will not attempt to close down cleanly. The process does not go down gracefully.</li>
<li><strong>SIGTERM</strong>: Signal 15. This is the default signal sent by <code>kill</code>. It is the standard program termination signal.</li>
<li><strong>SIGTSTP</strong>: Signal 20. Sent to a process when you use <code>Ctrl+Z</code>. It stops the process and puts it in the background.</li>
</ul><p>We must use the <code>kill</code> command to issue signals that do not have key combinations assigned to them.</p>
<h2>Further Job Control</h2>
<p>A process moved into the background by using <code>Ctrl+Z</code> is placed in the stopped state. We have to use the <code>bg</code> command to start it running again. To launch a program as a running background process is simple. Append an ampersand <code>&amp;</code> to the end of the command line.</p>
<p>Although it is best that background processes do not write to the terminal window, we’re going to use examples that do. We need to have something in the screenshots that we can refer to. This command will start an endless loop as a background process:</p>
<p>while true; do echo “How-To Geek Loop Process”; sleep 3; done &amp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441283" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10-4.png" alt="while true; do echo &quot;How-To Geek Loop Process&quot;; sleep 3; done &amp; in a terminal window" width="646" height="77" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>We are told the job number and process ID id of the process. Our job number is 1, and the process id is 1979.  We can use these identifiers to control the process.</p>
<p>The output from our endless loop starts to appear in the terminal window. As before, we can use the command line but any commands we issue are interspersed with the output from the loop process.</p>
<p>ls</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441284" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11-4.png" alt="output of the background loop process interspersed with output from other commands" width="646" height="337" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p>To stop our process we can use <code>jobs</code> to remind ourselves what the job number is, and then use <code>kill</code>.</p>
<p><code>jobs</code> reports that our process is job number 1. To use that number with <code>kill</code> we must precede it with a percent sign <code>%</code>.</p>
<pre>jobs</pre>
<pre>kill %1</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441286" data-pagespeed-lazy-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12-5.png" alt="jobs and kill %1 in a terminal window" width="646" height="337" src="https://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>
<p><code>kill</code> sends the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal, signal number 15, to the process and it is terminated. When the Enter key is next pressed, a status of the job is shown. It lists the process as “terminated.” If the process does not respond to the <code>kill</code> command you can take it up a notch. Use <code>kill</code> with <code>SIGKILL</code> , signal number 9. Just put the number 9 between the <code>kill</code> command the job number.</p>
<pre>kill 9 %1</pre>
<h2>Things We’ve Covered</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Ctrl+C</strong>: Sends <code>SIGINT</code>, signal 2, to the process—if it is accepting input—and tells it to terminate.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl+D</strong>: Sends <code>SISQUIT</code>, signal 3, to the process—if it is accepting input—and tells it to quit.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl+Z</strong>: Sends <code>SIGSTP</code>, signal 20, to the process and tells it to stop (suspend) and become a background process.</li>
<li><strong>jobs</strong>: Lists the background jobs and shows their job number.</li>
<li><strong>bg </strong><em>job_number</em>: Restarts a background process. If you don’t provide a job number the last process that was turned into a background task is used.</li>
<li><strong>fg</strong> <em>job_number</em>: brings a background process into the foreground and restarts it. If you don’t provide a job number the last process that was turned into a background task is used.</li>
<li><em>commandline</em> <strong>&amp;</strong>: Adding an ampersand <code>&amp;</code> to the end of a command line executes that command as a background task, that is running.</li>
<li><strong>kill %</strong><em>job_number</em>: Sends <code>SIGTERM</code>, signal 15, to the process to terminate it.</li>
<li><strong>kill 9</strong> <strong>%</strong><em>job_number</em>: Sends <code>SIGKILL</code>, signal 9, to the process and terminates it abruptly.</li>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 4 min<p>
Akkana's Musings on Open Source Computing and Technology, Science, and Nature.</p><div class="story"><p>I have a new laptop, a birthday present to myself last month. For once, rather than buying a cut-rate netbook, I decided to treat myself to a fancy Lenovo Carbon X1 with an up-to-date processor and lots of RAM.</p><p>Since I have way more resources than I'm used to, I decided I'd try installing a full Ubuntu and not trying to pare it down to a super lightweight system. I'm still running the lightweight, fast, highly configurable Openbox window manager instead of a full Gnome desktop: Openbox does just what I tell it and no more, and doesn't surprise me with random redesigns. But I did let Ubuntu install some system utilities I've always avoided in the past, like NetworkManager and PulseAudio. I decided I'd give them a chance, see if they've gotten better since I last checked.</p><p>They have, though they're still a bit of a hassle to deal with. NetworkManager can be controlled through nmcli, which is poorly documented but works okay if you google long enough to find the proper incancations. PulseAudio gave me a bit more trouble.</p><p>The standard GUI for controlling PulseAudio is <code>pavucontrol</code>. It showed two audio devices: "USB PnP Audio Device Analog Stereo" and "Built-in Audio Analog Stereo". Turns out the USB PnP option is a sound card built into the USB hub, a Totu tt-hb003a 11-in-1 USB-C hub that lets me connect to a charger, external monitor, SD and micro-SD slots, and extra USB ports without juggling a lot of extra cables.</p><p>Pulse assumes -- probably reasonably, though it's wrong in this case -- that if I have a USB audio device connected, I probably want to use it in preference to the laptop's built-in audio. That would make sense if I had external speakers plugged in, but I left all my computer speakers behind when I moved. I should probably order some speakers. But meanwhile, I needed to persuade PulseAudio to ignore the hub and use the laptop's built-in sound system.</p><h2>Mute/Unmute via the Keyboard</h2><p>The Lenovo, like most laptops, has a dedicated key for muting, Fn-F1. It even has a little light on it to show whether it's muted. In Openbox, pressing Fn-F1 actually muted the sound, and even turned on the light. This is probably because I'd previously set key="XF86AudioMute" to run <code>amixer set Master toggle</code> in <em>.config/openbox/rc.xml</em>, which worked on my Pulse-free pared-down Debian netbook. The problem is that pressing iFn-F1 again didn't bring the sound back. Instead, it was unmuting the USB hub's audio. Clicking "Set as fallback" on the built-in audio in pavucontrol made no difference.</p><p>It turns out that it is virtually impossible to persuade PulseAudio to use "Built-in Audio" when a "USB PnP Audio Device" is available. I finally found the secret: in pavucontrol's <em>Configuration</em> tab, set <em>Profile</em> for the PnP USB device to <em>Off</em>. Now only the built-in device shows up in the other tabs.</p><p>But that amixer command still wasn't unmuting properly, so the next step was to find a command that would actually unmute. Someone on #linux suggested <code>pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle</code> and that worked great from the command line. But when I tried to bind it in Openbox to the <em>XF86AudioMute</em> key, it did nothing. I still don't understand why not; I wasted a lot of time comparing my shell environment to openbox's environment and never found the difference.</p><p>Back to web searching, I found an <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/978984">askbuntu thread</a> suggesting some Openbox stanzas. In particular, it apparently works better to use alsamixer rather than pactl. This finally worked for toggling mute:</p><pre>
    &lt;keybind key="XF86AudioMute"&gt;
        &lt;action name="Execute"&gt;
            &lt;command&gt;amixer -q -D pulse sset Master toggle&lt;/command&gt;
        &lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;/keybind&gt;
</pre><h2>Volume Controls via Function Keys</h2><p>Partial success! Unfortunately, the volume control commands in that same askbuntu post, <code>amixer -q -D pulse sset Master 3%+ unmute</code>, did nothing. I had already noticed that in pavucontrol, the volume controls didn't work either. In fact, if I started some music playing and then called up alsamixer, channels like Master and Speaker didn't do anything; the only channel that affected volume was ALSA PCM. After some fiddling, I discovered that I had to change Master to PCM <em>and</em> remove the <em>-D pulse</em>:</p><pre>
    &lt;keybind key="XF86AudioRaiseVolume"&gt;
      &lt;action name="Execute"&gt;
            &lt;command&gt;amixer sset PCM 4%+ unmute&lt;/command&gt;
        &lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;/keybind&gt;
    &lt;keybind key="XF86AudioLowerVolume"&gt;
        &lt;action name="Execute"&gt;
            &lt;command&gt;amixer sset PCM 4%- unmute&lt;/command&gt;
        &lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;/keybind&gt;
</pre><p>I'm sure I'll eventually need to fiddle some more. For one thing, if I ever want to use audio during a talk (as I did briefly at my Stonehenge talk earlier this year) I'll need to figure out how to enable a temporary HDMI sound sink quickly without needing to fiddle with pavucontrol. But for now, I'm happy to have the basic laptop volume and mute keys working.</p>Tags:<a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/tags/linux" rel="tag">linux</a>,<a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/tags/audio" rel="tag">audio</a>,<a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/tags/cmdline" rel="tag">cmdline</a>,<a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/tags/window%20managers" rel="tag">window managers</a><br />[<em>15:43 Nov 24, 2019    <a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/linux" title="Category">More linux</a> | <a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/linux/pulseaudio-volume-cmdline.html" title="Permalink">permalink to this entry</a> | <a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/linux/pulseaudio-volume-cmdline.html#disqus_thread" title="comments">comments</a></em>]</div>]]>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 2 min<p>There's not a single month where I don't have to explain this. I thought it'd be a good opportunity to write about this <code>.gitignore</code> file so everyone is up to date on this magic file.</p><p>The <code>.gitignore</code> file is meant to be a list of files that <em>Git</em> should not track. It resides at the root directory of your repository. It can be a list of file path relative to the repository, or a list of wildcard. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">The file format and location is fully documented in Git documentation</a>.</p><p>For example, this is a valid content for a <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p><pre>foo
bar/*</pre><p>When you're using Git commands such as <code>git add</code>, all the files matching what's listed in <code>.gitignore</code> are ignored. That makes sure you don't commit a file that should not be there by mistake. In the example above, any file in the <code>bar</code> directory or any file named <code>foo</code> will be completely ignored by all <em>Git</em> commands.</p><p>Awesome!</p><p>Soon, developers realize that their directory is cluttered with temporary files. It might be from their build system, their editors or some test files they wrote.</p><p>So what do they do? They add those files to <code>.gitignore</code> for their project. You end up with a <code>.gitignore</code> file that contains entries like:</p><pre>*~
.vscode
*.DS_Store
.idea</pre><p>With that, you're sure to ignore backup files from <em>vim</em>, folders from MacOS and temporary files from Visual Studio code, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://julien.danjou.info/content/images/2019/11/giphy.gif" class="kg-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image" /></figure><p>Don't do this. Not everybody uses your editor or favorite pet tool, and nobody cares. The repository you're working in is shared with a lot of others developers. Sending pull requests to just add this kind of entry to ignore files generated by your pet editor is <em>wrong and annoying</em>.</p><p>If you read through <em>Git</em> documentation, the answer lies there: <em>Git</em> has a global ignore file that works for <strong>EVERY</strong> repository on your system. No need to hack <em>each</em> repository. By default, it's in <code>~/.config/git/ignore</code>. Here's mine:</p><pre>.#*
*.swp
.DS_Store
.dir-locals.el
.dir-locals-2.el</pre><p>That's enough to ignore my editors and OS files in all my repositories so I don't <code>git add</code> wrong files by mistake. You can tweak this global file location by changing by tweaking <code>core.excludesFile</code> in your <em>Git</em> configuration.</p><p>You should put in <code>.gitignore</code> all files and patterns that are generated by the build system of your project, or any file that it might output while running.</p><p>For example, for a Python project, it's common to have this:</p><pre>*.pyc
__pycache__</pre><p>With this, it makes sure that nobody is committing compiled Python files.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://julien.danjou.info/content/images/2019/11/tumblr_ma0id4kYlv1rv5x9bo1_400.gif" class="kg-image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image" /></figure><p>Thanks for reading through this. I hope you'll write better <code>.gitignore</code> files in the future. 🤞</p>]]>

</figure></div><div class="subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative" data-module="subbuzz-text"><p><strong>This summer,</strong> <strong>Elon Musk spoke</strong> to the National Governors Association and told them that “AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.” Doomsayers have been issuing similar warnings for some time, but never before have they commanded so much visibility. Musk isn’t necessarily worried about the rise of a malicious computer like Skynet from <em>The Terminator</em>. Speaking to Maureen Dowd for a Vanity Fair article published in April, Musk gave an example of an artificial intelligence that’s given the task of picking strawberries. It seems harmless enough, but as the AI redesigns itself to be more effective, it might decide that the best way to maximize its output would be to destroy civilization and convert the entire surface of the Earth into strawberry fields. Thus, in its pursuit of a seemingly innocuous goal, an AI could bring about the extinction of humanity purely as an unintended side effect.</p></div><blockquote class="subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4">

</blockquote><div class="subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative" data-module="subbuzz-text"><p>This scenario sounds absurd to most people, yet there are a surprising number of technologists who think it illustrates a real danger. Why? Perhaps it’s because they’re already accustomed to entities that operate this way: Silicon Valley tech companies.</p><p>Consider: Who pursues their goals with monomaniacal focus, oblivious to the possibility of negative consequences? Who adopts a scorched-earth approach to increasing market share? This hypothetical strawberry-picking AI does what every tech startup wishes it could do — grows at an exponential rate and destroys its competitors until it’s achieved an absolute monopoly. The idea of superintelligence is such a poorly defined notion that one could envision it taking almost any form with equal justification: a benevolent genie that solves all the world’s problems, or a mathematician that spends all its time proving theorems so abstract that humans can’t even understand them. But when Silicon Valley tries to imagine superintelligence, what it comes up with is no-holds-barred capitalism.</p></div><hr class="subbuzz subbuzz__section-divider subbuzz__section-divider--thin xs-block xs-mb4 xs-col-11" /><div class="subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative" data-module="subbuzz-text"><p><strong>In psychology,</strong> <strong>the term “insight”</strong> is used to describe a recognition of one’s own condition, such as when a person with mental illness is aware of their illness. More broadly, it describes the ability to recognize patterns in one’s own behavior. It’s an example of metacognition, or thinking about one’s own thinking, and it’s something most humans are capable of but animals are not. And I believe the best test of whether an AI is really engaging in human-level cognition would be for it to demonstrate insight of this kind.</p><p>Insight is precisely what Musk’s strawberry-picking AI lacks, as do all the other AIs that destroy humanity in similar doomsday scenarios. I used to find it odd that these hypothetical AIs were supposed to be smart enough to solve problems that no human could, yet they were incapable of doing something most every adult has done: taking a step back and asking whether their current course of action is really a good idea. Then I realized that we are already surrounded by machines that demonstrate a complete lack of insight, we just call them corporations. Corporations don’t operate autonomously, of course, and the humans in charge of them are presumably capable of insight, but capitalism doesn’t reward them for using it. On the contrary, capitalism actively erodes this capacity in people by demanding that they replace their own judgment of what “good” means with “whatever the market decides.”</p></div><blockquote class="subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4">

</blockquote><div class="subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative" data-module="subbuzz-text"><p>Because corporations lack insight, we expect the government to provide oversight in the form of regulation, but the internet is almost entirely unregulated. Back in 1996, John Perry Barlow published a manifesto saying that the government had no jurisdiction over cyberspace, and in the intervening two decades that notion has served as an axiom to people working in technology. Which leads to another similarity between these civilization-destroying AIs and Silicon Valley tech companies: the lack of external controls. If you suggest to an AI prognosticator that humans would never grant an AI so much autonomy, the response will be that you fundamentally misunderstand the situation, that the idea of an ‘off’ button doesn’t even apply. It’s assumed that the AI’s approach will be “the question isn’t who is going to let me, it’s who is going to stop me,” i.e., the mantra of Ayn Randian libertarianism that is so popular in Silicon Valley.</p><p>The ethos of startup culture could serve as a blueprint for civilization-destroying AIs. “Move fast and break things” was once Facebook’s motto; they later changed it to “Move fast with stable infrastructure,” but they were talking about preserving what they had built, not what anyone else had. This attitude of treating the rest of the world as eggs to be broken for one’s own omelet could be the prime directive for an AI bringing about the apocalypse. When Uber wanted more drivers with new cars, its solution was to persuade people with bad credit to take out car loans and then deduct payments directly from their earnings. They positioned this as disrupting the auto loan industry, but everyone else recognized it as predatory lending. The whole idea that disruption is something positive instead of negative is a conceit of tech entrepreneurs. If a superintelligent AI were making a funding pitch to an angel investor, converting the surface of the Earth into strawberry fields would be nothing more than a long overdue disruption of global land use policy.</p><p>There are industry observers talking about the need for AIs to have a sense of ethics, and some have proposed that we ensure that any superintelligent AIs we create be “friendly,” meaning that their goals are aligned with human goals. I find these suggestions ironic given that we as a society have failed to teach corporations a sense of ethics, that we did nothing to ensure that Facebook’s and Amazon’s goals were aligned with the public good. But I shouldn’t be surprised; the question of how to create friendly AI is simply more fun to think about than the problem of industry regulation, just as imagining what you’d do during the zombie apocalypse is more fun than thinking about how to mitigate global warming.</p><p>There have been some impressive advances in AI recently, like AlphaGo Zero, which became the world’s best Go player in a matter of days purely by playing against itself. But this doesn’t make me worry about the possibility of a superintelligent AI “waking up.” (For one thing, the techniques underlying AlphaGo Zero aren’t useful for tasks in the physical world; we are still a long way from a robot that can walk into your kitchen and cook you some scrambled eggs.) What I’m far more concerned about is the concentration of power in Google, Facebook, and Amazon. They’ve achieved a level of market dominance that is profoundly anticompetitive, but because they operate in a way that doesn’t raise prices for consumers, they don’t meet the traditional criteria for monopolies and so they avoid antitrust scrutiny from the government. We don’t need to worry about Google’s DeepMind research division, we need to worry about the fact that it’s almost impossible to run a business online without using Google’s services.</p><p>It’d be tempting to say that fearmongering about superintelligent AI is a deliberate ploy by tech behemoths like Google and Facebook to distract us from what they themselves are doing, which is selling their users’ data to advertisers. If you doubt that’s their goal, ask yourself, why doesn’t Facebook offer a paid version that’s ad free and collects no private information? Most of the apps on your smartphone are available in premium versions that remove the ads; if those developers can manage it, why can’t Facebook? Because Facebook doesn’t want to. Its goal as a company is not to connect you to your friends, it’s to show you ads while making you believe that it’s doing you a favor because the ads are targeted.</p><p>So it would make sense if Mark Zuckerberg were issuing the loudest warnings about AI, because pointing to a monster on the horizon would be an effective red herring. But he’s not; he’s actually pretty complacent about AI. The fears of superintelligent AI are probably genuine on the part of the doomsayers. That doesn’t mean they reflect a real threat; what they reflect is the inability of technologists to conceive of moderation as a virtue. Billionaires like Bill Gates and Elon Musk assume that a superintelligent AI will stop at nothing to achieve its goals because that’s the attitude they adopted. (Of course, they saw nothing wrong with this strategy when they were the ones engaging in it; it’s only the possibility that someone else might be better at it than they were that gives them cause for concern.)</p></div><blockquote class="subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-text-center">
<p>Silicon Valley has unconsciously created a devil in their own image, a boogeyman whose excesses are precisely their own.</p>
</blockquote><div class="subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative" data-module="subbuzz-text"><p><strong>There’s a saying,</strong> popularized by Fredric Jameson, that it’s easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. It’s no surprise that Silicon Valley capitalists don’t want to think about capitalism ending. What’s unexpected is that the way they envision the world ending is through a form of unchecked capitalism, disguised as a superintelligent AI. They have unconsciously created a devil in their own image, a boogeyman whose excesses are precisely their own.</p><p>Which brings us back to the importance of insight. Sometimes insight arises spontaneously, but many times it doesn’t. People often get carried away in pursuit of some goal, and they may not realize it until it’s pointed out to them, either by their friends and family or by their therapists. Listening to wake-up calls of this sort is considered a sign of mental health.</p><p>We need for the machines to wake up, not in the sense of computers becoming self-aware, but in the sense of corporations recognizing the consequences of their behavior. Just as a superintelligent AI ought to realize that covering the planet in strawberry fields isn’t actually in its or anyone else’s best interests, companies in Silicon Valley need to realize that increasing market share isn’t a good reason to ignore all other considerations. Individuals often reevaluate their priorities after experiencing a personal wake-up call. What we need is for companies to do the same — not to abandon capitalism completely, just to rethink the way they practice it. We need them to behave better than the AIs they fear and demonstrate a capacity for insight. ●</p></div><hr class="subbuzz subbuzz__section-divider subbuzz__section-divider--thin xs-block xs-mb4 xs-col-11" /><div class="subbuzz subbuzz-image xs-mb4 xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 md-col-6 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-pr3 subbuzz-image--align-left" data-module="subbuzz-image"><figure class="subbuzz__media"><div class="js-full-size-image subbuzz__media--full-width-container subbuzz__media-container js-subbuzz__media-container xs-mb05 subbuzz__media-container--no-margin-bottom js-unsupported-fallback js-progressive-image-container c4"><img class="subbuzz__media-image js-subbuzz__media js-progressive-image js-pinnable xs-col-12 xs-block c3" src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-12/14/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-13667-1513276447-3.jpg" alt="" data-mobile-src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-12/14/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-13667-1513276447-3.jpg?resize=990:637" data-crop="64.32" data-mobile-crop="64.34" data-span="1" data-bfa="@o:{ignore:[bfaBinder]};" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></div>

                <description>
                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 6 min<div class="jumbotron"><h2>User Input!</h2><p>Let's make our scripts interactive.</p></div><p>We looked at one form of user input (<a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-variables.php#arguments">command line arguments</a>) in the previous section. Now we would like to introduce other ways the user may provide input to the Bash script. Following this we'll have a discussion on when and where is best to use each method.</p><p>After the mammoth previous section this one is much easier to get through.</p><h2 id="read">Ask the User for Input</h2><p>If we would like to ask the user for input then we use a command called <strong>read</strong>. This command takes the input and will save it into a variable.</p><p class="commandoutline">read var1</p><p>Let's look at a simple example:</p><div class="page"><h4>introduction.sh</h4><ol><li>#!/bin/bash</li>
<li># Ask the user for their name</li>
<li>echo Hello, who am I talking to?</li>
<li>read varname</li>
<li>echo It\'s nice to meet you $varname</li>
</ol></div><p>Let's break it down:</p><ul><li><strong>Line 4</strong> - Print a message asking the user for input.</li>
<li><strong>Line 6</strong> - Run the command <strong>read</strong> and save the users response into the variable <strong>varname</strong></li>
<li><strong>Line 8</strong> - <strong>echo</strong> another message just to verify the read command worked. Note: I had to put a backslash ( \ ) in front of the ' so that it was escaped.</li>
</ul><div class="terminal"><ol><li>./introduction.sh</li>
<li>Hello, who am I talking to?</li>
<li><em>Ryan</em></li>
<li>It's nice to meet you Ryan</li>
</ol></div><ul><li>Note: Ryan above is in italics just to show that it was something I typed in. On your terminal input will show up normally.</li>
</ul><h3>More with Read</h3><p>You are able to alter the behaviour of <strong>read</strong> with a variety of command line options. (See the man page for read to see all of them.) Two commonly used options however are <strong>-p</strong> which allows you to specify a prompt and <strong>-s</strong> which makes the input silent. This can make it easy to ask for a username and password combination like the example below:</p><div class="page"><h4>login.sh</h4><ol><li>#!/bin/bash</li>
<li># Ask the user for login details</li>
<li>read -p 'Username: ' uservar</li>
<li>read -sp 'Password: ' passvar</li>
<li>echo</li>
<li>echo Thankyou $uservar we now have your login details</li>
</ol></div><ul><li>On lines 4 and 5 above we include the prompt within quotes so we can have a space included with it. Otherwise the user input will start straight after the last character of the prompt which isn't ideal from a readability point of view.</li>
</ul><div class="terminal"><ol><li>./login.sh</li>
<li>Username: <em>ryan</em></li>
<li>Password:</li>
<li>Thankyou ryan we now have your login details</li>
</ol></div><h3>More variables</h3><p>So far we have looked at a single word as input. We can do more than that however.</p><div class="page"><h4>cars.sh</h4><ol><li>#!/bin/bash</li>
<li># Demonstrate how read actually works</li>
<li>echo What cars do you like?</li>
<li>read car1 car2 car3</li>
<li>echo Your first car was: $car1</li>
<li>echo Your second car was: $car2</li>
<li>echo Your third car was: $car3</li>
</ol></div><div class="terminal"><ol><li>./cars.sh</li>
<li>What cars do you like?</li>
<li><em>Jaguar Maserati Bentley</em></li>
<li>Your first car was: Jaguar</li>
<li>Your second car was: Maserati</li>
<li>Your third car was: Bentley</li>
<li>./cars.sh</li>
<li>What cars do you like?</li>
<li><em>Jaguar Maserati Bentley Lotus</em></li>
<li>Your first car was: Jaguar</li>
<li>Your second car was: Maserati</li>
<li>Your third car was: Bentley Lotus</li>
</ol></div><p>The general mechanism is that you can supply several variable names to <strong>read</strong>. Read will then take your input and split it on whitespace. The first item will then be assigned to the first variable name, the second item to the second variable name and so on. If there are more items than variable names then the remaining items will all be added to the last variable name. If there are less items than variable names then the remaining variable names will be set to blank or null.</p><h2 id="stdin">Reading from STDIN</h2><p>It's common in Linux to <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/piping.php#piping">pipe</a> a series of simple, single purpose commands together to create a larger solution tailored to our exact needs. The ability to do this is one of the real strenghs of Linux. It turns out that we can easily accommodate this mechanism with our scripts also. By doing so we can create scripts that act as filters to modify data in specific ways for us.</p><p>Bash accomodates piping and redirection by way of special files. Each process gets it's own set of files (one for STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR respectively) and they are linked when piping or redirection is invoked. Each process gets the following files:</p><ul><li><strong>STDIN</strong> - /proc/&lt;processID&gt;/fd/0</li>
<li><strong>STDOUT</strong> - /proc/&lt;processID&gt;/fd/1</li>
<li><strong>STDERR</strong> - /proc/&lt;processID&gt;/fd/2</li>
</ul><p>To make life more convenient the system creates some shortcuts for us:</p><ul><li><strong>STDIN</strong> - /dev/stdin or /proc/self/fd/0</li>
<li><strong>STDOUT</strong> - /dev/stdout or /proc/self/fd/1</li>
<li><strong>STDERR</strong> - /dev/stderr or /proc/self/fd/2</li>
</ul><p><strong>fd</strong> in the paths above stands for file descriptor.</p><p>So if we would like to make our script able to process data that is piped to it all we need to do is read the relevant file. All of the files mentioned above behave like normal files.</p><div class="page"><h4>summary</h4><ol><li>#!/bin/bash</li>
<li># A basic summary of my sales report</li>
<li>echo Here is a summary of the sales data:</li>
<li>echo ====================================</li>
<li>echo</li>
<li>cat /dev/stdin | cut -d' ' -f 2,3 | sort</li>
</ol></div><p>Let's break it down:</p><ul><li><strong>Lines 4, 5, 6</strong> - Print a title for the output</li>
<li><strong>Line 8</strong> - <strong>cat</strong> the file representing STDIN, <strong>cut</strong> setting the delimiter to a space, fields 2 and 3 then sort the output.</li>
</ul><div class="terminal"><ol><li>cat salesdata.txt</li>
<li>Fred apples 20 December 4</li>
<li>Susy oranges 5 December 7</li>
<li>Mark watermelons 12 December 10</li>
<li>Terry peaches 7 December 15</li>
<li>cat salesdata.txt | ./summary</li>
<li>Here is a summary of the sales data:</li>
<li>====================================</li>
<li>apples 20</li>
<li>oranges 5</li>
<li>peaches 7</li>
<li>watermelons 12</li>
</ol></div><h2 id="which">So which should I use?</h2><p>So we now have 3 methods for getting input from the user:</p><ul><li>Command line arguments</li>
<li>Read input during script execution</li>
<li>Accept data that has been redirected into the Bash script via STDIN</li>
</ul><p>Which method is best depends on the situation.</p><p>You should normally favor command line arguments wherever possible. They are the most convenient for users as the data will be stored in their command history so they can easily return to it. It is also the best approach if your script may be called by other scripts or processes (eg. maybe you want it to run periodically using CRON).</p><p>Sometimes the nature of the data is such that it would not be ideal for it to be stored in peoples command histories etc. A good example of this is login credentials (username and password). In these circumstances it is best to <strong>read</strong> the data during script execution.</p><p>If all the script is doing is processing data in a certain way then it is probably best to work with STDIN. This way it can easily be added into a pipeline.</p><p>Sometimes you may find that a combination is ideal. The user may supply a filename as a command line argument and if not then the script will process what it finds on STDIN (when we look at If statements we'll see how this may be achieved). Or maybe command line arguments define certain behaviour but <strong>read</strong> is also used to ask for more information if required.</p><p>Ultimatately you should think about 3 factors when deciding how users will supply data to your Bash script:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use</strong> - which of these methods will make it easiest for users to use my script?</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Is there sensitive data which I should handle appropriately?</li>
<li><strong>Robustness</strong> - Can I make it so that my scripts operation is intuitive and flexible and also make it harder to make simple mistakes?</li>
</ul><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><div class="stuffwelearnt"><dl><dt>read varName</dt>
<dd>Read input from the user and store it in the variable varName.</dd>
<dt>/dev/stdin</dt>
<dd>A file you can read to get the STDIN for the Bash script</dd>
</dl></div><div class="importantconcepts"><dl><dt>Usability</dt>
<dd>Your choice of input methods will have an impact on how useable your script is.</dd>
</dl></div><h2 id="activities">Activities</h2><p>Let's dabble with input.</p><ul class="activities"><li>Create a simple script which will ask the user for a few pieces of information then combine this into a message which is echo'd to the screen.</li>
<li>Add to the previous script to add in some data coming from command line arguments and maybe some of the other system variables.</li>
<li>Create a script which will take data from STDIN and print the 3rd line only.</li>
<li>Now play about with creating a script which will behave as a filter. Create a script which will rearrange the output of the command <strong>ls -l</strong> in a useful way (eg maybe you only print the filename, size and owner) (Hint: <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/bonus.php#awk">awk</a> can be useful here).</li>

      		Open sans is much fat, and open sans bold looks bad, hence we choose noto sans as the replacement for arial

      		Why was this conceived?
      
      		- some font families look better hinted by Byte Code Interpreter (BCI)
      		while other fonts look better hinted by Auto-Hinter
      		- hinting type affects italic and bold fonts differently
      		- antialiasing needs to be adjusted according to font families and sizes
      
      		Essentially, there is no one single rule that works for all fonts.
      
      		NOTE:
      		- Verdana @ 8pt doesn't render '2' and '6' right
      		- Arial shows 'Z' distorted in Firefox 1.5

      		BAH, it looks good
      
      		Open Sans is cramped at 11px with autohint = true 
      		'sa' the s and a will stick badly
      		'50' the 5 and 0 will stick badly
      
      		But 12px onwards Open Sans is better than Noto Sans
      
      		But the vote goes to noto sans for verdana replaced to maintain beauty at 11px
      
      		Another note
      		noto sans has single stroke small g , open sans has the 2 round style g
      		noto sans p is thin, open sans p is better looking

      		1. very slightly STRETCHED
      		2. CRYSTAL CLARITY on webpages,  
      		3. lesser proportionate on desktop, CLARITY KIND OF OK OK
      		3. bold font ugly with hintfull, good with hintslight
      
      
      		Since we are using noto sans as arial replacement, hint it fully with autohinter.
      
      		hintslight will compromise clarity
      
      		thought of doing this, above 12px autohint = false
      		below 13px authint = true
      		but autohint false leads to loss of clarity, but makes width correct
      		moreover chrome does not obey pixelsize correctly

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 5 min<p>Ha! That's not true. I was just messing with you.</p><p>Sadly, there are folks out there saying that garbage without meaning it as a joke. There are writers who think the reason they're not getting published is because they're not a person of color or a member of the LGBTQIA+ community. The idea that social justice warriors have become the gatekeepers of the publishing world and have made it increasingly difficult for straight white men to get published is a thought I've encountered an inordinate amount of times, especially considering how fucking ridiculous it is. </p><p>Let me break things down for you. Don't worry, I won't fill your head with numbers. That said, I've been researching diversity in publishing for years, have written extensively about it, and have now started giving keynote speeches on the subject—so I have to throw some facts out there. For example, as a book reviewer, I belong to the 3% of book reviewers who are Latino/Latinx/Mexican. Three fucking percent. Sigh. Moving on. </p><p>...you can get out of our way and let us do our work, or you can stand in front of us to impede our progress... and watch us chop you down.</p><p>A study done by the Cooperative Children's Book Center at the School of Education in the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that the percentage of books depicting characters from diverse backgrounds is abysmally low. The study found that 10% of books featured African/African American characters; 7% featured Asian Pacific Islander/Asian Pacific American characters; 5% featured Latinx characters; and just 1% featured American Indian/First Nations characters. However, 50% of books featured white characters while 27% featured animal characters. Yeah, kids are exposed to talking animals in literature before they are exposed to black and brown folks. Obviously there are no gay characters. In any case, some of the same nonsense can be found in all other genres with little degrees of variance. I promised you I wouldn't drown you in numbers, so I'll leave it there. Want more? Come out to see me next time I give a keynote near you. </p><p>The idea that SJWs have somehow taken over publishing, which is still a predominantly white, straight business, is preposterous. The idea that those who have taken over are doing all they can to keep straight white men from getting published is so stupid I think even Trump would have a hard time coming up with it. Publishing, by and large, is still white. That said, I know why some writers are complaining. Here are three important reasons: </p><p>— Otherness is finally getting a bit of attention and publishers, agents, and editors are realizing how many amazing narratives there are coming from its core. </p><p>— Readers have started reading outside their comfort zone. Last week I talked to a huge room packed with librarians in Chicago. About 99.9% of them were white women. You know what? They were all talking about diversifying what they recommend. This, my friends, is a beautiful thing. Also, shout out to librarian extraordinaire Becky Spratford for being a force of nature and one of the strongest agents of change in that field. </p><p>— Writers of color are kicking ass. Look at Roxane Gay, Stephen Graham Jones, Atticka Locke, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Marlon James, Saeed Jones, Steph Cha, Celeste Ng, Carmen Maria Machado... the list goes on and on. Publishers and readers alike have noticed. Sorry, white dudes, but your shit can't suck it anymore. Want to get published now? Your work has to be good.  </p><p>There is still a lot of work to be done, but the face of publishing is changing. On one side of it are white folks who are excited about it. White agents and publishers and editors doing their part; great straight white writers writing blurbs and lending hands to upcoming POC, female, and queer writers; and straight white readers exploring a world most of their parents ignored and their grandparents probably spoke about using derogatory language. On the other side of this change are sour writers who think they aren't getting published because you now have to be an "African American lesbian" (someone said that on Twitter a while ago) to get a contract. To those who think that, let me say this: Fuck you. Write better stories.</p><p>Instead of writing a last paragraph making fun of those who believe in cancel culture and the SJW takeover in publishing, I'll copy and paste the last paragraph of my last keynote and offer it to you here as an invitation, a call to action, and a warning:  </p><p>"We no longer need to explore the homogenous nature of publishing and other creative endeavors. We have already stared at it for too long. We know what it looks like, how it acts, where it comes from, how it affects people, and how it limits opportunities for writers. What we need, friends, librarians, readers, publishers, and scholars, are interdisciplinary approaches to the problem that bring forth solutions. What we need is to use our power as writers, readers, and consumers to scream against a system that perpetuates the status quo. What we need is research that explores how fiction and nonfiction narratives can help us better understand, communicate, and process the immediate and lingering effects of displacement, change, acculturation, border crossing, bilingualism, colonialism, alienation, assimilation, homophobia, self-imposed exile, transphobia, racism, diaspora, transnationalism, hybridity, and the vast array of experiences that take place not only in the spaces these narratives carve for themselves in popular culture, but also in the interstitial spaces they occupy that are currently being overlooked. What we need is to work collectively to shine a light on all experiences coming from those inhabiting Otherness. What we need is to construct a discourse that makes the importance of these narratives obvious to those who are seemingly blind to it. What we need is to give each other the strength to say the following: The time for diversity is here and you have three options: you can work with us, you can get out of our way and let us do our work, or you can stand in front of us to impede our progress...and watch us chop you down."</p><p>Have a nice day.</p>]]>

The book was called <em>The Dragon Waiting</em>, and it was written by the late science fiction and fantasy author John M. Ford. Helen placed the mass-market paperback with its garish cover in my hands, her eyes aglow with evangelical fervor, telling me I would love it. I would soon learn that, owing to Ford’s obscurity, his fans do things like this all the time. Soon, I would become one of them.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbi88001a3g5y5eyzo0x0@published" data-word-count="89"><em>The Dragon Waiting</em> is an unfolding cabinet of wonders. Over a decade before George R.R. Martin wrote <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, Ford created an alternate-history retelling of the Wars of the Roses, filled with palace intrigue, dark magic, and more Shakespeare references than are dreamt of in our philosophy. <em>The Dragon Waiting</em> provokes that rare thrill that one gets from the work of Gene Wolfe, or John Crowley, or Ursula Le Guin. A dazzling intellectensorcells the reader, entertaining with one hand, opening new doors with another.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbi89001b3g5yvbswgwte@published" data-word-count="135">I wanted to buy a copy, but it was out of print. At the time, used copies of this mass-market paperback from 1985 started at $200 on Amazon. (It’s currently much more affordable.) John M. Ford had other books that were not available at all, even as used copies. How had a writer this good fallen into this level of obscurity? The more I looked into Ford’s career, the more frustrating and mystifying his posthumous invisibility came to seem. Ford had won the Philip K. Dick Award and multiple World Fantasy Awards. He was a beloved and influential peer to writers including Neil Gaiman, Jo Walton, Ellen Kushner, James Rigney (better known as Robert Jordan), Jack Womack, and Daniel Abraham. So why had so few people heard of him? Why wasn’t anyone publishing his books?</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbi8b001c3g5yjvc4tc1w@published" data-word-count="104">It would take me 18 months to answer my questions. My quest would bring me to the vast treasure trove of Ford’s uncollected and unpublished writing. It would introduce me to friends and relatives of Ford who hadn’t spoken to each other since his death in 2006. And, in an improbable ending worthy of a John M. Ford novel, my quest would in fact set in motion the long-delayed republication of his work, starting in the fall of 2020. How did this happen? More importantly, why was he forgotten in the first place? More importantly than that: How did he write those amazing books?</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbi8c001d3g5y33ukvzmy@published" data-word-count="136">John Milo Ford was born the first child of two pharmacists in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1957. Everyone called him Mike. According to his aunt, Jane Starner, “He was brilliant from the start—reading at an adult level when he was in kindergarten and talking to college students.” He played chess and loved model trains. But he was also sickly—after nearly falling into a coma at the age of 9, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At 16, he went to Indiana University, where instead of attending class he ran role-playing games and amassed a $3,000 library fine, which his father paid. He dropped out after two years, having already sold several stories, and soon after wrote his first novel, <em>Web of Angels</em>,a cyberpunk book before the term was invented. Pocket published it in 1980.*</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbi93001e3g5ys8yj569s@published" data-word-count="120">After that, Ford wrote, and wrote, and wrote. His <a href="http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?226">body of work</a> resembles some beast out of ancient Greek myth, all random appendages and vestigial organs, guarding a treasure. The torso of this body, supporting its many limbs, is made up of his novels. Each is written in a different genre (or, more often than not, multiple genres that overlap) but each is recognizably his. “When you’re reading a Mike Ford novel, you knew it instantly,” said Beth Meacham, one of his editors at Tor. “Every book contained a puzzle of some sort. And the play with language. He would use a word, and if that word had multiple meanings, he meant to use all of them in that sentence.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbib8001g3g5yd8f12cay@published" data-word-count="128">All his novels also contain at least one lengthy stretch where the reader will be utterly baffled. Key events will be recounted elliptically, and vital connections will be revealed in a tossed-off detail. Inference, close reading, and faith that the author knows what he’s doing are essential for navigating these moments, which I came to think of as Iceberg Passages, after the novelist Jo Walton explained them to me. “You’re only seeing the tenth of the iceberg that’s out of the water in every novel,” she said. “It makes it dense in a really <em>powerful</em> way, but sometimes it’s too hard for people because he wouldn’t spell things out.” When his editors would ask him to explain himself more, he’d respond, “I have a horror of being obvious.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbibl001h3g5ye9mn227o@published" data-word-count="134">Ford also wanted his works to flow from characters who felt like real people, and real people do not go around expounding on the rules of their universes, nor do they always understand what’s going on, particularly if they lack power, as Ford’s characters often do. If there’s one unifying theme to his books, it’s a deep skepticism of power and its costs. In <em>The Dragon Waiting</em>, a woman you think might become a crack assassin instead becomes paralyzed with guilt after committing her first murder. <em>The Last Hot Time</em>, an urban fantasy about bootleggers and elves, stars a character ashamed of his own desire to be a dom in bed. <em>Growing Up Weightless</em>, a story of political intrigue on the moon, is told not by the diplomats and governors, but by their children.</p><p>“Had he taken <em>The Dragon Waiting</em> and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would’ve been George R.R.Martin.” — Neil Gaiman</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbic3001i3g5ypjjsj6yv@published" data-word-count="170">But the novels were only the beginning. The ephemera of John M. Ford could fill volumes, if you could locate all of it. He performed an improvised live show called “Ask Dr. Mike” at sci-fi conventions, where audience members shouted out absurd questions and he replied with even more absurd answers. He wrote handbooks for the GURPS and Paranoia role-playing game systems. He drew the maps for several fantasy and science fiction novels, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HTJTX1C/?tag=slatmaga-20"><em>The Eye of the World</em></a>, the first book in Robert Jordan’s <em>Wheel of Time</em> series. His blog comments are the stuff of legend. (His final one was <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008034.html">a villanelle about King Edward IV</a>.) Among his friends, his most prized pieces of writing were his Christmas cards, lovingly made documents containing poems, or stories, or short satirical plays that he would send to a small list of associates every year during the holidays. One of the cards, a poem called “Winter Solstice, Camelot Station<em>,”</em> went on to win the World Fantasy Award. (You can read it <a href="https://sigridellis.wordpress.com/2014/12/21/winter-solstice-camelot-station-by-john-m-ford/">here</a>.)</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbif8001k3g5ysg7c3bb1@published" data-word-count="97">“He would make art in the most surprising places,” Gaiman told me. “Once he wrote a short play based on the invitation and directions to my annual Guy Fawkes party. There was a typo, and he took that as the grounds for a play.” When Ford visited his editor Teresa Nielsen Hayden at her office at Tor, he would scribble short parody poems of the documents on her desk and leave them for her to find. “Life was not long enough,” she recalled, “for Mike to do all the stuff that he would think of to do.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbigo001l3g5y5t4zpn0w@published" data-word-count="47">“He could have had a more successful career,” Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa’s husband and Tor’s editor in chief, said, “if he had been more disciplined about his writing” and stuck to one genre, or written a series. “But Mike wanted to write what he wanted to write.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbihn001m3g5y72d367hn@published" data-word-count="158">No single example illustrates this better than <em>The Dragon Waiting</em> and its aftermath. As Gaiman put it, “Had he taken <em>The Dragon Waiting</em> and written a sequence of five books based in that world, with that power, he would’ve been George R.R. Martin.” Ford opted instead to write two <em>Star Trek</em> novels (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671038532/?tag=slatmaga-20"><em>The Final Reflection</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671038591/?tag=slatmaga-20"><em>How Much for Just the Planet?</em></a>, both unexpected delights) and <em>The Scholars of Night</em>, a riff on midcentury British espionage thrillers with no fantastical elements and a lost Christopher Marlowe play at its center. Gaiman still bemoans that <em>The Scholars of Night “</em>should’ve been marketed like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0544176561/?tag=slatmaga-20"><em>The Name of the Rose</em></a>.You needed to go, `We have a great writer who is really fucking brilliant and he has written a book that combines high and low culture.’ ” Instead, Tor, which had been recently acquired by St. Martin’s, published <em>Scholars</em> with a blank back cover. It didn’t exactly do Umberto Eco–level business.</p><figure data-uri="slate.com/_components/image/instances/ck2zbnic000083g5yfpj7kzlj@published" class="image image--center" data-editable="imageInfo"><div class="lazy-container c1"><img class="image__src" data-normal="https://compote.slate.com/images/176910db-d158-4a0d-8cf7-27eeb6e9be90.jpeg?width=780&amp;height=520&amp;rect=1560x1040&amp;offset=0x0" alt="Neil Gaiman and John M.

And so he didn’t.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbik8001o3g5y1o57md6g@published" data-word-count="128">To the extent that Ford’s health was ever stable, it was due to MinnesotaCare, a health benefit for low-income residents of the state, which helped cover a kidney transplant. (Earlier surgery to keep Ford from going blind was made possible by the doctor’s willingness to waive part of his fee.) To the extent that his finances were ever stable, it was due to the largesse of his friends, particularly Harriet McDougal, who co-edited <em>The Scholars of Night</em>, and her husband, the late James Rigney, who wrote as Robert Jordan. The couple hired Ford to work as a “games consultant” for the <em>Wheel of Time</em> series, mostly to help keep him solvent. By then, McDougal and Rigney, who would eulogize Ford as his “blood brother,” had essentially adopted him.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbikw001p3g5y5b4xkfjg@published" data-word-count="87">Ford needed a sibling or two, as he had grown estranged from his own family. The causes of the rift are unclear. Ford told some of his friends that his mother disapproved of his work, possibly for religious reasons. Jane Starner says that Ford’s biological family were conservative Christians; Ford’s attitude toward religion was epitomized by the short story he wrote <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/000845.html">where God cheats at Scrabble</a>. But according to multiple people I spoke to, also at issue was Ford’s partner, the writer and jewelry designer Elise Matthesen.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbilk001q3g5yghyccnpy@published" data-word-count="68">The two became romantically involved in 1993. Matthesen, a polyamorist, had been married for two years when she and Mike began dating. “My partner to whom I am married is John with middle initial M, and Mike was John with middle initial M,” Matthesen recalled in an email. “I used to refer to them collectively as my John M. Ponytails, as they both wore their hair that way.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbim9001r3g5yg7ur6pmp@published" data-word-count="51">“The thing with Elise bothered” Ford’s family, Starner said. “I don’t know whether they were completely estranged before that or not.” But either way, at some point, Ford’s now-deceased father told Starner that “the only way I know he’s alive is because he cashes the checks I send for his birthday.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbimy001s3g5yovkpuoe1@published" data-word-count="53">In his final years, Ford toiled away at a colossal work, over 140,000 words long, titled <em>Aspects</em>. Beth Meacham described it as “a magical-parliamentary-nobility-romance-spy-adventure. And that only touches it.” When he’d finish chunks of it, he’d fire them off to close friends, including Gaiman, Walton, and Meacham. They were all amazed by it.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbink001t3g5yucmc0er4@published" data-word-count="75">Although Ford had outlined the book in a sonnet cycle (seriously), he struggled to get it right. On July 27, 2006, he emailed Gaiman about how hard it was to weave action into some parts of the story. “It’s not exactly like I can have someone charge into the room with a gun every few minutes,” he wrote. Then, in signing off, he launched into one of the spontaneous riffs that so delighted his friends:</p><blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/ck2zbfgnk002e3g5ykyw2ikkn@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="78">
<div data-editable="text"><p>If a guy comes into the room holding a symbol of true kingship, the book is a high fantasy.</p><p>If he is holding a sword with pizza sauce on the blade and is accompanied by a talking penguin, it is low fantasy.</p><p>If he is holding a poorly described article that is clearly of great emotional significance to himself, but none whatever to us, and then he leaves the room without having done anything, it is a New Yorkerstory.</p></div>
</blockquote><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbiol001v3g5yhmdz3d0d@published" data-word-count="143">Two months later, he died of natural causes, most likely a heart attack. He was heavily in debt, and almost all of his work was out of print. Elise Matthesen found him. “He looked a little surprised,” she wrote in an email. “Sort of mildly quizzical. Not pained. Which was some comfort at least.” Although he had written a will, it was neither witnessed nor executed, and was therefore legally invalid, as was his relationship with Elise. The two had “married,” but in a <a href="https://elisem.livejournal.com/903525.html">self-scripted</a> Klingon ceremony during a convention. (“The Klingon Empire has decided that we should formalize our relationship,” was how Ford described it to friends.) Elise found contact information for Ford’s family, whom she had never met, and told them of Ford’s passing. She would have one phone conversation with Ford’s mother. After that, everything would be done through lawyers.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbir2001w3g5yo1it4sws@published" data-word-count="133">According to a document Matthesen prepared for her lawyers in October of 2006, Ford’s unexecuted will specified that he did not want his family to get his estate. But the document had been left in Ford’s apartment, which she could no longer legally access. Matthesen and Ford’s friends wanted some say in the disposition of his effects, but their efforts to secure this through counsel were unsuccessful. The family claimed Ford’s body, cleaned out his apartment, and, shortly after, left town. His friends and loved ones held their own memorial service, which Jane Starner attended. All contact between Ford’s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little but bitterness, particularly when, a couple of months later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AJohn_M._Ford">someone tried to edit Ford’s Wikipedia page</a> to remove all mention of Elise Matthesen.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbish001x3g5y6ur7z6ng@published" data-word-count="147">By 2018, when I started digging into this story, only <em>The Last Hot Time</em>, the story collection <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/031285546X/?tag=slatmaga-20"><em>Heat of Fusion</em></a>,and the two <em>Star Trek</em> novels remained in print. The rights to almost everything else, including all of his major works, his uncollected writings, and the unpublished <em>Aspects,</em> had reverted to his legal heirs. No one knew what had become of Ford’s family. No one had had contact with them since the summer of 2007, when Gaiman, McDougal, and Rigney unsuccessfully tried to purchase Ford’s literary estate and set up a foundation to administer it. No one even remembered their names. The story, repeated to me again and again (and, occasionally, <a href="https://jamesdavisnicoll.com/review/if-you-listen-you-can-understand">online</a>) was that Ford’s family did not approve of his work and were deliberately keeping it out of print. And then, after several months of looking, I found them, and asked them for comment on this article.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbitc001y3g5y0rcux9lx@published" data-word-count="81">An agreeable, funny woman in her 80s, Jane Starner lives in a retirement community in North Manchester, Indiana. She spoke with pride of her late nephew, and sadness that things soured so thoroughly between him and the family. But she was very surprised when I asked her if her sister and niece were suppressing his work. She gave me an email address for Ford’s sister, Martha Fry. “I cannot believe Martha would not want his books back in print<strong>,”</strong> she said.</p><p>All contact between Ford’s immediate family and his family of choice dissolved, leaving behind little butbitterness.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbits001z3g5yrf4qpxxz@published" data-word-count="127">Martha Fry and her brother Dale Ford agreed to an interview, but only if they could do it together, and only if it were done over email. Over the course of that interview, Dale and Martha disputed that Mike was estranged from them or his parents, saying instead he was “introverted by nature.” “I once visited Mike with our parents in Minneapolis at his apartment,” Dale wrote. “We went to an old school downtown steakhouse, where our father treated us to dinner. … Our parents sent him letters every year with updates about his family. We found some of the opened letters among his belongings.” Martha added that shortly before their father’s death, he and Mike had corresponded, and the letter Mike wrote was “kind and loving.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbiuh00203g5ypi1trrug@published" data-word-count="88">They also disputed that anyone had a problem with Mike’s relationship with Elise. “Mike’s personal life was his own business and did not affect our feelings for him as a family,” Dale wrote. “I am appreciative to [Elise] for finding Mike’s body and calling the police. … Martha read a copy of the police report, and Elise listed her relationship to Mike as ‘friend,’ not a legal spouse or domestic partner, which we presume to be accurate. I am glad Mike found caring friends during his adult life.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbivp00213g5y53nz4u12@published" data-word-count="106">They refused to discuss anything having to do with his estate. But multiple friends of Mike Ford had told me that they were suppressing his work. I wrote back, saying that I needed comment from them if they wanted to dispute that. Ford and Fry replied that I was threatening them with “the unsubstantiated beliefs of uncited individuals … if we do not respond to your satisfaction on Mike’s commercial affairs.” However, they volunteered that on three separate occasions they had written to Mike’s agent, trying to see if there was any interest in reprinting his work. When they didn’t hear back, they assumed there wasn’t.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbiw900223g5y2q87u9qg@published" data-word-count="46">This seemed improbable. Every one of his colleagues in the industry loved Ford and wanted his work back in print. His agent stood to make money off the deal. Was it really possible, I asked Ford’s friends, that his agent could have ignored his family’s requests?</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbix400233g5y79y9s3ny@published" data-word-count="79">The answer, it turned out, was yes, because Ford’s agent had dropped out of the industry and, seemingly, off the face of the earth. According to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, shortly before Ford’s death, his agent Valerie Smith “was beginning the process of essentially vanishing” from the industry. She “became more and more intermittent” with phone calls and correspondence, and many of her clients fired her. Neither he nor anyone he knew had had contact with her in a decade.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbixw00243g5ygmiiwb4i@published" data-word-count="132">After a few tries, I eventually reached Valerie Smith by phone.  Smith still found it difficult to talk about Mike Ford’s death and the events surrounding it. She had represented him since 1978. <em>Web of Angels </em>was the first novel she ever sold. But in the 1990s, family caregiving obligations and a legal battle unrelated to her literary work left her “pretty overwhelmed,” she said. Her heartbreak over Mike Ford’s death, an event that still leaves her angry today, helped push her further out of the industry. “When I started, I really felt like this was where I was meant to be,” she said. “I just can’t bring myself to go out there with the same enthusiasm that I had before.” Smith said she never received any correspondence from the family about republishing Mike Ford’s work.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbiym00253g5ycesq86yn@published" data-word-count="89">And so, after months of investigation, I found myself in an Iceberg Passage, seeing only some of the story while, lurking beneath the surface, other truths remained obscure. I do not share Ford’s horror at obviousness, but there are simply things that we will never know. We will never know why Mike and his family grew apart, or, from the family’s perspective, how far apart they were. We will never know who anonymously tried to edit the Wikipedia page to cut out Elise Matthesen. (The family denies any involvement.)</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbizh00263g5y817sxu94@published" data-word-count="84">But I reconnected Ford’s family and editors at Tor, and after a year of delicate back-and-forth spearheaded by Beth Meacham, Tor and the family have reached an agreement that will gradually bring all of his books back into print, plus a new volume of stories, poems, Christmas cards, and other uncollected material. First up, in fall 2020, is the book that introduced me to Ford, <em>The Dragon Waiting</em>.Then, in 2021, Tor will publish—at long last—the unfinished <em>Aspects</em>, with an introduction by Neil Gaiman.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbj0400273g5yidskr1v0@published" data-word-count="68">As in one of John M. Ford’s novels, a kind of happy ending has been reached. It’s not the ending the characters necessarily wanted. It’s not one that ties up every plot thread. No one in the story has enough power to make that happen. But the ending they’ve carved out reaches some kind of resolution and leaves their world a bit better off than when they started.</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbj3800283g5yenz3e8md@published" data-word-count="41">When I got word that a deal had finally been struck, I immediately thought of Elise Matthesen. Lacking the legal rights to Mike Ford’s work, still smarting from the events surrounding his death, how would she feel about all of this?</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbj3v00293g5yx8l6zg4t@published" data-word-count="18">“I don’t even have words, it’s such good news,” she replied in an email. “Except maybe Mike’s words.”</p><p class="slate-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ck2zbbj4k002a3g5yiclcjsvg@published" data-word-count="33">In 1997, Elise wrote, she interviewed Mike for a convention.

$ service apache2 start</pre><p>There are two drawbacks:</p><ol><li>The startup time is long. The init process is started in a serial manner, so the next process will be started only after the previous process finishes starting.</li>
<li>The startup script is complicated. The init processonly executes the startup script, so the script needs to handle various situations, which often makes the script very long.</li>

Systemd takes the place of <code>initd</code>, and it becomes the first process of the system (PID is 1), and other processes are its child processes.</p><pre class="language-bash">$ systemctl --version</pre><p>The above command is used to check the version of Systemd.</p><p>The advantages of Systemd are that it's powerful and easy to use. The disadvantages are that it's huge and complex. In fact, ​many people opposes Systemd on the grounds that it is too complex and strongly coupled with the rest of the operating system, and they think that it violates the Unix philosophy of "keep simple, keep stupid".</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.tutorialdocs.com/upload/2019/04/systemd-command-3.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p><p>(The Systemd architecture diagram)</p><h2>3. System Management</h2><p>Systemd doesn't mean a command, but means a set of commands that cover all aspects of system management.</p><h3>3.1 systemctl</h3><p><code>systemctl</code> is the main command of Systemd for managing systems.</p><pre class="language-bash"># Reboot the system
$ sudo systemctl reboot
# Turn off the system and cut off the power

$ systemd-analyze                                                                                       
# View the startup time of each service
$ systemd-analyze blame

$ hostnamectl
# Set the host name
$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname rhel7</pre><h3>3.4 localectl</h3><p>The <code>localectl</code> command is used to view localization settings.</p><pre class="language-bash"># View localization settings

$ loginctl list-sessions
# List the currently logged-in users
$ loginctl list-users
# List the information showing the specified user
$ loginctl show-user ruanyf</pre><h2>4. Unit</h2><h3>4.1 Unit</h3><p>Systemd can manage all system resources. All of the different resources are collectively referred to as Unit.</p><p>We can divide the Unit into 12 types.</p><ul><li>Service unit: system service</li>
<li>Target unit: A group of multiple units</li>
<li>Device Unit: Hardware device</li>
<li>Mount Unit: Mount point of the file system</li>
<li>Automount Unit: Auto Mount Point</li>
<li>Path Unit: file or path</li>
<li>Scope Unit: An external process that is not started by Systemd</li>
<li>Slice Unit: Process Group</li>
<li>Snapshot Unit: Systemd snapshot; you can switch back to a certain snapshot</li>
<li>Socket Unit: Socket for interprocess communication</li>
<li>Swap Unit:swap file</li>
<li>Timer Unit: Timer</li>
</ul><p>The <code>systemctl list-units</code> command can be used to view all the Units of the current system.</p><pre class="language-bash"># List the running Unit
$ systemctl list-units
# List all the Units, including the ones which doesn't find the configuration file or fails to start
$ systemctl list-units --all
# List all the Units that doesn't run
$ systemctl list-units --all --state=inactive
# List all the Units that fails to load
$ systemctl list-units --failed
# List all the running Units of which type is service
$ systemctl list-units --type=service</pre><h3>4.2 Status of Unit</h3><p>The <code>systemctl status</code> command is used to view the system status and the status of a single unit.</p><pre class="language-bash"># Display the system status
$ systemctl status
# Display the status of a single unit
$ sysystemctl status bluetooth.service
# Display the status of a unit on the remote host
$ systemctl -H root@rhel7.example.com status httpd.service</pre><p>In addition to the <code>status</code> command, <code>systemctl</code> also provides three simple methods for querying the status, which are mainly used in the judgment statement in the script.</p><pre class="language-bash"># Show whether a Unit is running
$ systemctl is-active application.service
# Show whether a Unit is in a boot failure state
$ systemctl is-failed application.service
# Show whether a Unit service has established an enabled link
$ systemctl is-enabled application.service</pre><h3>4.3 Unit Management</h3><p>The most common commands are the following ones which are used for starting and stopping Unit (service mainly).</p><pre class="language-bash"># Start a service
$ sudo systemctl start apache.service
# Stop a service
$ sudo systemctl stop apache.service
# Restart a service
$ sudo systemctl restart apache.service
# Kill all the child processes of a service
$ sudo systemctl kill apache.service
# Reload the configuration files of a service
$ sudo systemctl reload apache.service
# reload all the modified configuration files
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# Show all the underlying parameters of a Unit
$ systemctl show httpd.service
# Show the value of the specified property of a Unit
$ systemctl show -p CPUShares httpd.service
# Set the specified property of a Unit
$ sudo systemctl set-property httpd.service CPUShares=500</pre><h3>4.4 Dependencies</h3><p>If Unit A depends on Unit B, then Systemd will start Unit B when it starts Unit A.</p><p>The <code>systemctl list-dependencies</code> command is used to list all the dependencies of a Unit.</p><pre class="language-bash">$ systemctl list-dependencies nginx.service</pre><p>Some dependencies of the output for the above command are of the type Target, and it won't be expanded by default. If you want to expand Target, you need to use the <code>--all</code> parameter.</p><pre class="language-bash">$ systemctl list-dependencies --all nginx.service</pre><h2>5. Unit Configuration Files</h2><h3>5.1 Configuration files</h3><p>Each Unit has a configuration file that tells Systemd how to start the Unit.</p><p>By default, Systemd reads the configuration file from the directory <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code>. However, most of the files stored inside are symbolic links, which point to the directory <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</code>, and the real configuration files are stored in this directory.</p><p>The <code>systemctl enable</code> command is used to establish a symbolic link relationship between the two directories above.</p><pre class="language-bash">$ sudo systemctl enable clamd@scan.service
# which is equivalent to
$ sudo ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/clamd@scan.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/clamd@scan.service'</pre><p>If you have set powerboot in the configuration file, the <code>systemctl enable</code> command is equivalent to activating it.</p><p>Correspondingly, the <code>systemctl disable</code> command is used to revoke the symbolic link relationship between the two directories, which is equivalent to canceling the boot.</p><pre class="language-bash">$ sudo systemctl disable clamd@scan.service</pre><p>The suffix name of the configuration file is the type of the Unit, such as <code>sshd.socket</code>. If omitted, Systemd will set the suffix name to <code>.service</code> by default, so <code>sshd</code> will be interpreted as <code>sshd.service</code>.</p><h3>5.2 Status of the configuration file</h3><p>The <code>systemctl list-unit-files</code> command is used to list all configuration files.</p><pre class="language-bash"># List all the configuration files
$ systemctl list-unit-files
# List the configuration files of the specified type
$ systemctl list-unit-files --type=service</pre><p>This command will output a list.</p><pre class="language-bash">$ systemctl list-unit-files
UNIT FILE              STATE
chronyd.service        enabled
clamd@.service         static
clamd@scan.service     disabled</pre><p>There are four status for each configuration file.</p><ul><li>enabled: It has been established the enabled link.</li>
<li>disabled: It has not established the enabled link.</li>
<li>static: The configuration file does not have the [Install] section (cannot be executed), so it can only be used as a dependency of other configuration files.</li>
<li>masked: The configuration file is forbidden to establish an enabled link.</li>
</ul><blockquote class="note">
<p>Note that we can't know from the status of the configuration file whether the Unit is running. Here we need to execute the <code>systemctl status</code> command mentioned earlier.</p>
</blockquote><pre class="language-bash">$ systemctl status bluetooth.service</pre><p>Systemd needs to reload the configuration file and restart it as long as the configuration file is modified, otherwise the modification will not take effect.</p><pre class="language-bash">$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart httpd.service</pre><h3>5.3 Format of the configuration file</h3><p>Configuration files are plain text files that can be opened with a text editor.</p><p>The <code>systemctl cat</code> command can be used to view the contents of the configuration file.</p><pre class="language-bash">$ systemctl cat atd.service
[Unit]
Description=ATD daemon
[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/atd
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</pre><p>As you can see from the output above, the configuration file is divided into several blocks. The first line of each block is the distinguished name which is in square brackets, such as <code>[Unit]</code>. Note that the block name and field name of the configuration file are case sensitive.</p><p>Inside each block are some key-value pairs connected with equal sign.</p><pre class="language-bash">[Section]
Directive1=value
Directive2=value
. . .</pre><blockquote class="note">
<p>Note that there must be no spaces on either side of the equal sign of the key-value pairs.</p>
</blockquote><h3>5.4 Blocks of configuration files</h3><p>The <code>[Unit]</code> block is usually the first block of the configuration file, and it's used to define the metadata for the Unit and configure the relationship to other Units. Its main fields are as follows.</p><ul><li>Description</li>
<li>Documentation: Document Address</li>
<li>Requires: Other Units that the current Unit depends on. If they are not running, the current Unit will fail to start.</li>
<li>Wants: Other Units that work with the current Unit. If they are not running, the current Unit will not fail to start.</li>
<li>BindsTo: Similar to Requires. If the Unit specified by it exits, it will cause the current Unit to stop running.</li>
<li>Before: If the Unit specified by this field is also to be started, it must be started after the current Unit.</li>
<li>After: If the Unit specified by this field is also to be started, it must be started before the current Unit.</li>
<li>Conflicts: The Unit specified here cannot be run simultaneously with the current Unit.</li>
<li>Condition...: The condition that the current Unit must satisfy, otherwise it will not run.</li>
<li>Assert...: The condition that the current Unit must satisfy, otherwise it will fail to start.</li>
</ul><p><code>[Install]</code> is usually the last block of the configuration file, and it's used to define how to start, and whether it starts up automatically. Its main fields are as follows.</p><ul><li>WantedBy: Its value is one or more Targets. When the current Unit is enabled, the symbolic link will be placed in the subdirectory consisting of the Target name + .wants suffix which is under the /etc/systemd/system directory.</li>
<li>RequiredBy: Its value is one or more Targets. When the current Unit is enabled, the symbolic link will be placed in the subdirectory consisting of the Target name + .required suffix. which is the /etc/systemd/system directory.</li>
<li>Alias: The alias ​​that the current Unit can be used to start</li>
<li>Also: Other Units that will be enabled at the same time when the current Unit is enabled.</li>
</ul><p>The <code>[Service]</code> block is used for the configuration of the Service. Only the Unit of the type Service has this block. Its main fields are as follows.</p><ul><li>Type: Define the behavior of the process at startup. Its values are as follows.</li>
<li>Type=simple: The default value. It executes the command specified by ExecStart, and starts the main process.</li>
<li>Type=forking: Create a child process from the parent process in the fork mode. After the creation, the parent process will exit immediately.</li>
<li>Type=oneshot: One-time process. Systemd will wait for the current service to exit, and then move on executing.</li>
<li>Type=dbus: The current service is started by D-Bus.</li>
<li>Type=notify: After the current service finishes starting, it will notify Systemd, and then go on executing.</li>
<li>Type=idle: The current service will run only after other tasks have finished executing.</li>
<li>ExecStart: The command to start the current service.</li>
<li>ExecStartPre: The command executed before starting the current service.</li>
<li>ExecStartPost: The command executed after starting the current service.</li>
<li>ExecReload: The command executed when restarting the current service.</li>
<li>ExecStop: The command executed when stopping the current service.</li>
<li>ExecStopPost: The command executed after stopping the current service.</li>
<li>RestartSec: The number of seconds of the interval for restarting the current service automatically.</li>
<li>Restart: Define the circumstances on which Systemd will restart the current service automatically, and its possible values ​​include always, on-success, on-failure, on-abnormal, on-abort, on-watchdog.</li>
<li>TimeoutSec: Define the number of seconds Systemd waits before stopping the current service.</li>
<li>Environment: Specify the environment variables.</li>
</ul><p>Go to the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for the complete list of the Unit configuration files.</p><h2>6. Target</h2><p>It needs to start a large number of Units when starting the computer. So, it is obviously inconvenient if we need to write out each time which Units are needed for the startup. The solution provided in Systemd is Target.</p><p>Simply put, Target is a Unit group with many related Units. When a Target is started, Systemd will start all the Units inside the Target.</p><p>In the traditional <code>init</code> startup mode, there is a concept of RunLevel, which is similar to the role of Target. The difference is that RunLevel is mutually exclusive, so it's not possible to start multiple RunLevels at the same time; But multiple Targets can be started at the same time.</p><pre class="language-bash"># View all the Targets of the current system.
$ systemctl list-unit-files --type=target
# View all the Units included in a Target.
$ systemctl list-dependencies multi-user.target
# View the default target at startup.
$ systemctl get-default
# Set the default Target that is at the startup.
$ sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
# When switching Targets, the process started by the previous Target won't be closed by default.
# The systemctl isolate command can be used to change this behavior:
# Close all the processes which are in the previous Target but won't be used in the next Target.
$ sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target</pre><p>The correspondences between the Target and the traditional RunLevel are as follows.</p><pre class="language-bash">Traditional runlevel      New target name     Symbolically linked to...
Runlevel 0           |    runlevel0.target -&gt; poweroff.target
Runlevel 1           |    runlevel1.target -&gt; rescue.target
Runlevel 2           |    runlevel2.target -&gt; multi-user.target
Runlevel 3           |    runlevel3.target -&gt; multi-user.target
Runlevel 4           |    runlevel4.target -&gt; multi-user.target
Runlevel 5           |    runlevel5.target -&gt; graphical.target
Runlevel 6           |    runlevel6.target -&gt; reboot.target</pre><p>The main differences between it and the <code>init</code> process are as follows.</p><p>(1) The default RunLevel (can be set in the <code>/etc/inittab</code> file) is now replaced by the default Target. The default Target locates in <code>/etc/systemd/system/default.target</code>, which is usually symbolically linked to <code>graphical.target</code> (graphical interface) or <code>multi-user.target</code> (multi-user command line).</p><p>(2) The previous startup script locates in the <code>/etc/init.d</code> directory, which is symbolically linked to different RunLevel directories (such as <code>/etc/rc3.d</code>, <code>/etc/rc5.d</code>, etc.), while it is now stored in the <code>/lib/systemd/system</code> and <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> directories.</p><p>(3) The previous location of the configuration file: The configuration file of the <code>init</code> process is <code>/etc/inittab</code>, and the configuration files of various services are stored in the <code>/etc/sysconfig</code> directory; The configuration file now is mainly stored in the <code>/lib/systemd</code> directory, and the the original settings can be overridden by modifying in the <code>/etc/systemd</code> directory.</p><h2>7. Log Management</h2><p>Systemd manages the startup logs for all Units. So you can view all the logs (kernel logs and application logs) with just one command of <code>journalctl</code>. The configuration file for the log is <code>/etc/systemd/journald.conf</code>.</p><p>The command <code>journalctl</code> is very powerful.</p><pre class="language-bash"># View all the logs (Only the logs started this time are saved by default.)
$ sudo journalctl
# View the kernel logs (The application logs are not displayed.)
$ sudo journalctl -k
# View the logs that are started this time.
$ sudo journalctl -b
$ sudo journalctl -b -0
# View the logs that were last started (you need to change the settings).
$ sudo journalctl -b -1
# View the logs for the specified time.
$ sudo journalctl --since="2012-10-30 18:17:16"
$ sudo journalctl --since "20 min ago"

# 0: emerg
# 1: alert
# 2: crit
# 3: err
# 4: warning
# 5: notice
# 6: info
# 7: debug
$ sudo journalctl -p err -b
# The output for logs is paging by default. You can use --no-pager to change it to normal standard output.
$ sudo journalctl --no-pager
# Output in the JSON format (a single line).
$ sudo journalctl -b -u nginx.service -o json

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 6 min<div class="Block Block--textBlock"><p>Desert rock pioneers <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/kyuss/">Kyuss</a> took their name from a Dungeons &amp; Dragons monster; one-man black metal band Isengard’s logo was swiped directly from the Middle-earth Role Playing game; and, decades before Stranger Things, there were a host of groups named after the ultimate D&amp;D baddie, the Demogorgon.</p><p>Metal and table-top role-playing games have shared influences since their beginnings. To this day there remain a handful of bands who proudly proclaim their love of RPGs, and plenty more who have been inspired by them, one way or another.</p></div><p></p><h2>The Quest Begins</h2><div class="Block Block--textBlock"><p>In the mid 1960s, J. R. R. Tolkien’s bucolic Middle-earth became an unlikely part of the hippy counter-culture, and his influence trickled down through numerous bands formed in its wake. Robert Plant’s lyrics for Led Zeppelin’s Ramble On were famously inspired by Lord Of The Rings, and Tolkien’s Gandalf was apparently very much on Geezer Butler’s mind when he wrote the words for <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/black-sabbath/">Black Sabbath</a>’s The Wizard. While early metallers were busy plotting a musical journey over the Misty Mountains however, others were channelling their newfound fantasy fascinations in a different direction.</p><p>Born out of the war gaming world, tabletop role-playing game Chainmail went on sale 13 months after Sabbath’s self-titled debut arrived in record stores. Chainmail’s rules included a fourteen page ‘fantasy supplement’, written by a young Chicagoan named Gary Gygax, who was heavily inspired the magic, creatures, and characters of Tolkien’s works, as well as those of Robert E. Howard, and other fantasy authors.</p><p>Chainmail’s Fantasy elements expanded through subsequent editions until, in 1974, Gygax’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules for the game were published. D&amp;D quickly became synonymous with fantasy gaming. Within a decade of its release, D&amp;D had three million players worldwide, becoming the most widely played and well-known tabletop RPG ever.</p></div><p></p><h2>Gaming Music</h2><div class="Block Block--textBlock"><p>The November 1987 edition of UK RPG magazine White Dwarf was advertised as a ‘Thrash Rock Special’. “Your eyes and minds have been devastated by White Dwarf for the past ten years, now it’s time for your ears to get it!” an ad in the back of the previous issue warned. The magazine came with a free flexidisc whose single track, Blood For The Blood God, was specially written and recorded by British thrashers Sabbat for WD. Printed on the disc are the words “Based on Games Workshop’s Warhammer fantasy roleplay game”, making Blood For The Blood God the first ever official RPG tie-in metal record.</p><p>Two years later, death-grind band <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/bolt-thrower/">Bolt Thrower</a> released their second album, Realm Of Chaos: Slaves To Darkness, on Earache Records. The album’s cover art came courtesy of Nottingham-based RPG maker and retailer Games Workshop. Many of the song titles and lyrics related directly to the store’s own sci-fi fantasy RPG, Warhammer 40,000 – of which members of Bolt Thrower were dedicated players. Copies of the album were even sold in Games Workshop, alongside the usual miniatures and rulebooks.<br /></p><p>In the 1990s Games Workshop started their own label, Warhammer Records. Warhammer released a handful of records by bands like <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/saxon/">Saxon</a> and Wraith, but only put out one RPG-specific album. D-Rok’s Oblivion was based in the same Warhammer 40,000 fantasy world as Realm Of Chaos; where heavily armoured Space Marines do battle with aliens (largely sci-fi twists on standard D&amp;D fantasy creatures). Despite a guest appearance by Queen guitarist Brian May however, Oblivion didn’t make much of an impact outside of Games Workshop’s established clientele.<br /></p></div><p></p><h2>Devils &amp; Demons</h2><div class="Block Block--textBlock"><p>During the 1980s, the American media went into a tailspin of conservative Christian paranoia. The Satanic Panic (as it became known) saw all kinds of people suddenly accused of Satanic practices, child abuse, and even murder. Metal and Dungeons &amp; Dragons were branded as recruiting tools for Satanism and witchcraft. Despite all the leaflets distributed outside schools, and TV specials exposing the ‘truth’ about both, D&amp;D and metal survived the decade without any real shred of evidence against them.</p><p>In 1990s Norway however, black metal bands like <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/emperor/">Emperor</a>, and Burzum did their best to practice exactly what conservative America worried that fantasy gaming and metal were preaching. Murders, suicides, and church burnings carried out by various band members caught the attention of the worldwide press. The most notorious figure of the scene was Varg Vikernes of Burzum, who in 1993 murdered Mayhem guitarist Euronymous. Varg’s pseudonym, Count Grishnackh, was taken directly from Lord Of The Rings’ orc captain Grishnákh. Burzum is itself a name taken from Tolkien – his orcish word for darkness. Convicted of murder and arson, Vikernes served 15 years of a 21-year sentence and was released from prison in 2009.<br /></p><p>Vikernes released his own RPG: Mythic Fantasy Role-playing Game (MYFAROG for short) in 2015. MYFAROG is by all accounts a rather old-fashioned and overtly right-wing version of the Middle-earth RPG from which Vikernes and other black metallers drew their inspiration – much of its content based upon his own neo-Nazi and white nationalist beliefs.</p><p>In 2017, US based Tempest Tome Games released Cryptic Explorers - a table-top RPG with an unmistakably black metal aesthetic: spells, weapons, and creatures within the game are named after songs by Mayhem, Leviathon, Emperor, and more.</p></div><p></p><h2>Roll The Dice</h2><div class="Block Block--textBlock"><p>As so-called Nerd Culture has been more embraced by the mainstream – superhero films grossing billions at the box office, comic books sharing shelf space with Shakespeare – RPGs have undergone something of a renaissance in recent years. Jamie Hooper, former screamer for <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/3-inches-of-blood/">3 Inches of Blood</a> (whose Destroy The Orcs remains a metal RPG favourite) was quoted in a 2007 interview saying “Yes, we do play Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and we’re not ashamed to admit it.” More recently Connor Murphy of post-rock band Foxing <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-rock-band-loves-playing-dungeons-dragons-between-1827402560">has professed his love of playing RPGs between shows</a>.</p><p>In 2014 Utah’s Visigoth released the D&amp;D inspired track Dungeon Master (<em>‘Take a chance, roll the dice / Is this hell or paradise?’</em>). The same year the video for <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/mastodon/">Mastodon</a>’s High Road referenced both tabletop fantasy gaming and live-action role-playing (LARPing).</p></div><div class="Block Block--textBlock"><p>Perhaps the most overtly RPG-inspired band of the moment are Gygax. Named in honour of D&amp;D’s creator, the Californian four-piece play Thin Lizzy-esque hard rock with themes lifted directly from the players’ handbook. Songs on their 2019 album, High Fantasy, reference D&amp;D monsters like the Beholder (The Eyes Have It) and the Displacer (Light Bender). Not only that, but the High Fantasy vinyl sleeve folds out into a Dungeon Master’s screen – so that you can DM your latest adventure from behind the epic cover art created by Games Workshop artist Fares Maese.</p><p>For years it seemed that rock and metal bands were doing their best to distance themselves from their sword and sorcery loaded past, but today many bands and fans appear keen to embrace the fantasy-laden side of the genre once more. A whole new world of adventure awaits us; all we have to do is roll the dice…</p></div><div class="Block Block--textBlock"><p><strong>Read this next:</strong></p></div><p>Posted on July 24th 2019, 4:34pm</p><a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/dungeon-masters-how-role-playing-games-influenced-heavy-metal/" class="Button Entry--expand">Read More</a>]]>

We plan to start a new project that has us building a completely custom control panel on a dedicated and completely custom new screen on your device. Or, if you’d prefer, this is how you build a Scene in <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/tag/tasker">Tasker</a>.</p><p>Tasker has a tool built-in called Scenes, which is a method of building your own custom screens or popups on your device. The builder offers up a no frills <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-studio-tutorial-beginners-637572/">developer’s IDE</a> type design and functionality, where you start with your overall screen or popup layout, then drop buttons, text and more onto it and re-size them to fit your tastes.</p><p>With near unlimited things you can do with Scenes, including building your own Android apps, we are going to keep it simple with a control panel, just so we can focus on the tools instead of the project.</p><h3>Before we begin</h3><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" class="aa_button cbs_button add-active right c4">Tasker - Google Play Store</a>You know what I’m about to say, don’t you! You will need Tasker installed on your device today. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" target="_blank">Tasker is $2.99 in the Google Play Store</a> and is one of our <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-apps-312570/">favorite Android apps of all time</a>. At least I speak for myself when I say that I use no other app as much as I use Tasker, and it is all automated, so I don’t even notice in my daily routine.</p><p>Check out what we’ve used <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/tag/tasker">Tasker</a> for in the past to see if it is right for you.</p><p>Please allow me to explain the project a little more. For starters, please be forewarned, we are less concerned with building a control panel than we are with learning how to use Scenes in <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/advanced-battery-log-tasker-android-customization-644296/">Tasker</a>. We will see the project through, probably using a future article or two to go through the elements available for a Scene. For today, we will keep it extremely simple, just in case you were expecting some sort of magic, not today.</p><p>Now that we know we are building a Scene, let’s look a little closer at what a Scene is and what you can do with it.</p><h2>What is a Tasker Scene?</h2><p>Simply put, a Scene in Tasker is a custom built screen or window on which you place buttons, images, text and more. A scene may be displayed in several methods, including as a small popup window all the way up to being a full screen activity, just like a real app. Further, when you display these Scenes, you may choose them to act as a fully functional app would, or just as a transparent overlay, with a few related options in between.</p><noscript>

It is no problem to trust your own, but as a Scene is able to create a full screen transparent overlay, I would be cautious about any third party Scenes that can be downloaded from the internet. Acting with the full permissions of Tasker, any ‘app’ built on a Tasker Scene should be verified that it will not hijack your display or steal your input in any way.</p><p>Disclaimer out of the way, please take a moment to think about what you want out of the project today. You will be responsible for all design aspects of this project, which is much easier to handle when you know what you want ahead of time.</p><p>We will be keeping it simple, we will only be placing one item on our Scene. You are encouraged to add more, but the process is pretty much the same for any element, so we’ll just add one.</p><p>Enough of that, let’s start looking at building our own Scene in Tasker.</p><h2>Build a Scene in Tasker</h2><p>Open Tasker and head over to the Scene tab.</p><p>You will see a default Scene already in place, you could use it, but I’d rather you create a new one.</p><p>Tap on the “+” icon to add a new Scene. Provide an appropriate name to it. I’ll go with “ControlPanel“.</p><noscript>

This size will vary based on your available display resolution, meaning that, by default, a Scene should be built for only devices with this same resolution. You may have to re-build your project when you get a new device.</p><p>Tap and drag a side or corner of the transparent box to give it new dimensions. It will auto-center on your screen, do not worry, we provide placement details when we deploy the Scene later. Just pick your desired shape and size and we’ll start adding elements.</p><noscript>

You can now figure out how you wish to trigger this Task, either right here with the play button or maybe by setting a Task shortcut on your Homescreen. I’ll leave it to you for now to figure out when and how you access your new control panel, but I may just have a new project coming soon that would work for you. No hints, it’s a surprise.</p><h3>What’s next</h3><p>For fun, I added an extra element to my volume changer. At first glance it is just a Text element that displays the current media volume, but wait, there’s more. Using the range of options on this element style, I was able to make is so that a single tap of the text mutes the media volume. A long press of the text cranks up to full volume. Best of all, swipe up from the text to add one to the volume, then swipe down to decrease the volume by one. Hint: if you pursue this yourself, remember to update the current value of both the slider and the text after making any volume changes.</p><noscript>

Be sure to poke around and explore the different functions. Let’s be honest, if all you want is a settings toggle, perhaps with a way to enter the full system Settings, you don’t need Tasker, just use your stock <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/custom-notifications-homescreen-639039/">Android notification panel</a> quick settings menu.</p><p>Please do not get caught up on the fact that we are playing with Scenes to create a control panel, there are many other uses for them. As a quick example, we’ve heavily utilized the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/tasker-notification-popup-539144/">Alert Flash notification</a> action in our Tasker projects, if ever those flash popups were ill suited to your desires, a Scene could be used in place.</p><noscript>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 4 min<p class="p1"><a target="_blank" class="autolink" title="View more Depression stories" href="https://themighty.com/depression/">Depression</a> for me has always been concealed. I’ve always been what they call “high-functioning.” I’m able to hold down a job, go about my day just like everyone else, and — for the most part — maintain healthy relationships with those around me.</p><p class="p1">Every single person I’ve come across has told me they never would have guessed I was depressed if I hadn’t told them.</p>
<p class="p1">I have what they call smiling depression. I love the concept of laughter and smiling at people; brightening someone’s day is what my goal is every single day. I don’t like sulking in my own sadness 24/7, and I sure as hell hate bringing other people down because of my depression. I speak about it publicly. But that’s to help end the stigma. When someone asks me how I am that day, I’m never honest. Because in reality, they don’t actually want to hear about how incredibly sad I am on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="p1">On the outside, people see the happy, bubbly, carefree woman. But in reality, they have no idea. I don’t know if it’s ironic, but within the last three weeks, I have had two different people tell me I look so happy with life. My response to them was a little laugh, and “if only you knew my friend, if only you knew.” Neither of them know of my history with mental illness, and I wasn’t going to bore them with putting down their statement and explaining to them that it’s really the complete opposite.</p>
<p class="p1">My depression — in reality — is this:</p>
<p class="p1">It’s pretending like nothing is wrong. It’s not anyone screaming for help; it’s actually the person staying silent. It’s the tears I cry without anyone knowing because I have no other way to express the overwhelming amount of emotions. It’s the plans canceled last minute because I can’t seem to muster up the strength and energy to go do anything. It’s the two days off spent in bed instead of doing something fun because I’m too exhausted from pretending all week. It’s that dark cloud that hangs over my head and never seems to go away. It creeps up on me during the most unexpected times. It lurks and waits for something great to happen, just so it can ruin it and convince me it’s actually something terrible. It’s the fear of happiness because I know that at some point, it’s bound to fade away just like the memories. It’s faded memories and a cloudy mind, unable to recall important things that have occurred in my life. It is numbing and leaves me unable to function on the really bad days.</p>
<p class="p1">The truth is, I’m not happy with my life… at all. Nothing inside of me wants to continue living a life riddled with <a target="_blank" class="autolink" title="View more anxiety stories" href="https://themighty.com/anxiety/">anxiety</a> and consumed by depression and trauma. I think about death on a regular basis, yet I’m not technically suicidal.</p>
<p class="p1">I have those few genuine moments in which my laugh or smile is real. But for the most part, even when I’m smiling or laughing, I’m breaking on the inside. Even when I try to have those moments of happiness and pureness, depression still lingers; reminding me that the sadness is greater. I wish I could just tell people that. I wish I didn’t have to pretend. In all honesty, it’s the most exhausting thing I have ever done. I’m so tired when I get home each day and it’s not because of lack of sleep or working all day. It’s from pretending to be happy and bubbly all day long.</p>
<p class="p1">No one understands what it’s like to be trapped in such darkness, with no way out and appear to be happy. No one understands how exhausting it is to put that mask on every single day. No one understands how badly I just want them to genuinely ask how I’m doing — and be ready to listen to me talk about sad I am. Because sometimes, talking about it and sulking in it aren’t always the same thing.</p>
<p class="p1">On the bright side, smiling depression has its benefits. I’m not the stereotypical depressed person that you see on the commercials for antidepressants. People have a positive view of me instead of judging me for constantly being sad. My stepmom has always told me I light up any room I walk into. Other people have told me the same thing, and that’s comforting, because I don’t want to bring them down with my sadness when I walk into the room.</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe I do it to try to give myself a glimpse of what it’s like to be happy. Maybe I do it to try to convince myself I’m not actually depressed (even though we all know that’s a lie). Who knows why I do it. All I know is I’ve been like this since I was diagnosed at 12.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s to you thinking I’m the happy girl.</p>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 3 min<p>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a highly stigmatised and misunderstood condition. Australians with BPD face considerable barriers to accessing high-quality and affordable care, according to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ap.12400">new research</a> published today.</p><p>For every 100 patients we treat in inpatient psychiatric wards, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jpm.12226">43 will have</a> BPD. People with this condition are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725357">vulnerable</a>, impulsive, and highly susceptible to criticism – yet they continue to face <a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/26848/">stigma and discrimination</a> when seeking care.</p>
<p>We have come a long way since the days of viewing mental illness as a sign of weakness, but we are lagging behind in our attitude towards BPD. At least part of this stems from the way we frame the condition, and from the name itself.</p>
<p>Rather than as a personality disorder, BPD is better thought of as a complex response to trauma. It’s time we changed its name.</p>
<h2>How common is BPD?</h2>
<p>BPD is strikingly common, <a href="https://www.sane.org/mental-health-and-illness/facts-and-guides/borderline-personality-disorder">affecting between 1% and 4%</a> of Australians. It is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)16770-6/fulltext">characterised by</a> emotional dysregulation, an unstable sense of self, difficulty forming relationships, and repeated self-harming behaviours.</p>
<p>Most people who suffer from BPD have a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178105000508">history of major trauma</a>, often sustained in childhood. This includes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2929750">sexual and physical abuse</a>, extreme neglect, and separation from parents and loved ones.</p>
<p>This link with trauma – particularly physical and sexual abuse – has been <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.2018">studied extensively</a> and has been shown to be near-ubiquitous in patients with BPD.</p>
<p>People with BPD who have a history of serious abuse <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117312921?via%3Dihub">have poorer outcomes</a> than the few who don’t, and are more likely to self-harm and attempt suicide. Around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15237043">75% of BPD patients attempt suicide</a> at some point in their life. One in ten eventually take their own life.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/borderline-personality-disorder-is-a-hurtful-label-for-real-suffering-time-we-changed-it-41760">Borderline personality disorder is a hurtful label for real suffering – time we changed it</a></strong></em></p>
<hr /><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) does not mention trauma as a diagnostic factor in BPD, despite the inextricable link between BPD and trauma. This adds to viewing BPD as what its name suggests it is – a personality disorder.</p>
<p>Instead, BPD is better thought of as a trauma-spectrum disorder – similar to chronic or complex PTSD.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.2018">similarities</a> between complex PTSD and BPD are numerous. Patients with both conditions have difficulty regulating their emotions; they experience persistent feelings of emptiness, shame, and guilt; and they have a significantly elevated risk of suicide.</p>

<p>Labelling people with BPD as having a personality disorder can exacerbate their poor self-esteem. “Personality disorder” translates in many people’s minds as a personality flaw, and this can lead to or exacerbate an ingrained sense of worthlessness and self-loathing.</p>
<p>This means people with BPD may view themselves more negatively, but can also lead other people – including those closest to them – to do the same.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/mood-and-personality-disorders-are-often-misconceived-heres-what-you-need-to-know-94971">Mood and personality disorders are often misconceived: here's what you need to know</a></strong></em></p>
<hr /><p>Clinicians, too, often <a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/26848/">harbour negative attitudes</a> towards people with BPD, viewing them as manipulative or unwilling to help themselves. Because they can be hard to deal with and may not engage with initial treatment, doctors, nurses and other staff members <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725357">often react</a> with frustration or contempt.</p>
<p>These attitudes are <a href="https://scholarworks.smith.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2041&amp;context=theses">much less frequently seen</a> from clinicians working with people suffering from complex PTSD or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4623286/">other trauma-spectrum disorders</a>.</p>
<h2>What could a name change do?</h2>
<p>Explicitly linking BPD to trauma could alleviate some of the stigma and associated harm that goes with the diagnosis, leading to better treatment engagement, and better outcomes.</p>
<p>When people with BPD sense that people are distancing themselves or treating them with disdain, they may respond by self-harming or refusing treatment. Clinicians may in turn react by further distancing themselves or becoming frustrated, which perpetuates these same negative behaviours.</p>
<p>Eventually, this <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10673220600975121?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">may lead to</a> what US psychiatric researcher Ron Aviram and colleagues call a “self-fulfilling prophecy and a cycle of stigmatisation to which both patient and therapist contribute”.</p>
<hr /><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href="http://theconversation.com/biology-is-partly-to-blame-for-high-rates-of-mental-illness-in-women-the-rest-is-social-75700">Biology is partly to blame for high rates of mental illness in women – the rest is social</a></strong></em></p>
<hr /><p>Thinking about BPD in terms of its underlying cause would help us treat its cause rather than its symptoms and would reinforce the importance of preventing child abuse and neglect in the first place.</p>
<p>If we started thinking about it as a trauma-spectrum condition, patients might start being viewed as victims of past injustice, rather than perpetrators of their own misfortune.</p>
<p>BPD is a difficult condition to treat, and the last thing we need to do is to make it harder for patients and their families.</p>]]>

<p>I don't consider myself a hypersexual person but I do want a sexual relationship. My current boyfriend I have been with for about eight years and I love him deeply. He is my best friend. But he hasn't been in the mood for any sexual encounters (including just making out) for over a year. It started as a relatively slow decline probably about three years ago. I would try to initiate something but more often than not be rejected. Three years ago we were having sex maybe four times a year, then last year more like two times, and this year nothing at all. I've stopped trying to initiate as much but I will about once a month but I was rejected the last 12-15 times I tried. I love him but for personal fulfillment purposes I need a sexual relationship and I'm absolutely not looking to cheat. I'm in my early twenties and I'm a fit and healthy but maybe he's just not attracted to me anymore? Or he's bored? But he still says all the sweet things he used to. It's just that it feels like I'm back in college living with a roommate and not a boyfriend. IDK what to do. I've brought the subject up before but it's not something he likes to discuss so I feel like the subject is pretty much off limits at this point. He says he only wants to be with me and I don't feel like he's cheating. He's just, IDK, not that into me? But still loves me? Maybe? How do I navigate this?</p>

<p><em>Sexual Connection Absent, Relationship Entirely Delightful</em></p>
</blockquote><p>You ask yourself if you can take another twenty or thirty years of this—decades of rejection, decades of feeling unwanted, decades of sexual frustration—and then break the fuck up with this guy, nice as he is, because you need a sexual relationship for personal fulfillment purposes and he isn't willing or able to meet your sexual needs.</p><p>It would be one thing if he could talk with you about this—about the central problem in your relationship—but he's managed to convince you that any discussion about the collapse of your sexual relationship is "off limits." If we were talking about his relationship with his siblings or a comic book collection stuffed in a storage unit somewhere, sure, he could declare the subject off limits, none of your business, etc. But you're in a monogamous relationship with him and this topic—<em>your shared sex life</em>—involves you intimately and you have every right to raise the subject.</p><p>And it's fine if he’s not as sexual as you are or he's asexual, SCARED, but if the reasonable assumptions you made at the start of the relationship and/or the explicit promises you made each other at the start—that he would be your exclusive sex partner, that you would be his exclusive sex partner—are no longer operative, SCARED, then you'll have to hammer out a mutually agreeable compromise/accommodation. And that requires discussion. If he doesn't want sex as often as you do, perhaps he could hold you/engage with you while you masturbate. But if he's no longer interested in sex with you at all—if he's incapable of meeting your reasonable sexual needs—then you'll need his permission to get them met elsewhere if you're going to remain together. If it's something else—if he's struggling with depression or or experiencing erectile problems—then he needs to explain what proactive steps he's taking to work on his mental and/or physical health and let you know roughly when you can expect to see a light/cock at the end of the/your tunnel.</p><p>You say you're in your early twenties and you've been with this guy for eight years—so you've been with him since high school. So it's possible your relationship has simply run its course. You share a long history and the relationship is loving (still) and low-conflict (for now)—it sounds like there's real affection here—buy you don't have to hate someone to break up with them. It's possible to love someone before, during, and after a breakup. The ability to recognize when a good relationship has run its course and to end it before it gets ugly—before you cheat on him in desperation, for instance, or engineer some other conflict so you can get out—is an important life skill, SCARED, on that will serve you well in your future relationships.</p><p><a href="mailto:mail@savagelove.net">mail@savagelove.net</a></p><p>••••••••••••••••••••••••••••</p><br /><div class="c10"><em>Listen to my podcast, the Savage Lovecast, at <a href="http://www.savagelovecast.com/"><strong>www.savagelovecast.com</strong></a>.</em><p><em>Impeach the motherfucker already!

<p>I can back this up. It isn’t only their shelters.</p>
<p>I have a family friend who worked at our local Salvation Army headquarters as a a secretary. This particular office took all the Christmas donations for children in need, put them in a warehouse, and on a designated day the staff and their friends picked through them all, taking whatever they wanted. She saw people hauling away bikes donated for specific families. Some local children had hundreds of dollars of gifts donated in their name, and on Christmas they received three cheap things, items likely not even from the person who sponsored them.</p>
<p>My friend quit, and I’ve not given them a dime of my money since then.</p>
<p>Do not give to the Salvation Army.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Do Not. Give. To. Salvation. Army</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>My turn.</p><p>I’m a wildfire and disaster logistics specialist.</p><p>I deal with a lot of agencies who provide disaster relief.</p><p>I used to say the Salvation Army’s disaster services were the one (literally the ONE) good thing they did.</p><p>They would come in, set up a canteen trailer, make and pass out hot coffee and donated food in a disaster, usually being one of the first agencies to get there and the last to leave.</p><p>Then I found out.</p><p>Every time they did this, regardless of if they were actually invited or deployed by the agency in charge (usually FEMA, sometimes others) they would SELF-DEPLOY. Meanjng they would just show up. Ok. That’s not TOO bad, sometimes agencies have to take initiative and get there before the red tape is sorted out. BUT. They, after they left at the end of the incident, they would send FEMA or the host agency a BILL. They used one or two paid employees (usually the driver of the truck and a supervisor); and many VOLUNTEERS, but they would bill for EVERYONE’s Labor at standard federal rates. They would bill for the food they distributed even though it was all donated by another agency or private parties. They would bill for the coffee they made and the supplies. Except they would use electricity from the shelter location, water from donations or from the shelter, and in many cases, they would get the coffee and industrial filters DONATED, but bill for them at retail prices.</p>]]>

Constantly doubting your self-worth.</strong> Where once you were self-confident and assured, you are now in people-pleasing mode. Your friends and family notice that you are always on edge, doubting your strengths and experiences. You’re constantly explaining yourself, deflecting compliments or evading opportunities to shine. You obsess over whether you’re worthy, attractive, appealing or desirable enough. You begin to wonder if <em>you’re</em> the one who’s toxic and abusive when you start <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2018/01/what-if-youre-the-narcissist/">reacting to the abuse</a> (after all, narcissists are prone to projecting their own behavior and calling us narcissists as a defense mechanism). You start to think that <em>you</em> must be the problem if you’re being treated in such a horrendous manner. This sort of self-blame is common after abuse, but it is one that is rooted in the effects of trauma, <em>not</em> reality.</p><p><strong>2. Questioning your ability to make the right decisions or perceive reality correctly.</strong> Narcissists are masters of warping our reality and inviting us to play in their funhouse (more like torture chamber) of distortions, falsehoods, smoke and mirrors. When you’ve been <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2017/11/50-shades-of-gaslighting-the-disturbing-signs-an-abuser-is-twisting-your-reality/">gaslighted</a> for so long into believing that what you’re experiencing isn’t real, you doubt whether you’re even perceiving your own reality correctly. You second-guess your decisions and feel a tremendous amount of conflict about doing what’s right for you versus what you’ve been conditioned to do for the narcissist. You develop a sense of cognitive dissonance (conflicting thoughts and feelings) about the toxic relationship as well as other major facets of your life.</p><p><strong>3. Chasing after toxic people.</strong> The more toxicity a narcissistic partner brings into your life, the more likely you’ll gravitate towards people who subject you to similar trials. It’s because you’ve been subconsciously programmed to abusive behavior as a new normal. As a result, you might have a very distorted perception about what healthy behavior actually entails.</p><p>Instead of searching for healthier alternatives, those who have been abused by narcissists try to <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2017/11/the-invisible-war-zone-5-ways-children-of-narcissistic-parents-self-destruct-in-adulthood/">“search for a rescuer”</a> but wind up encountering more people who are toxic. These experiences can compound the trauma you’ve experienced. It can mirror the self-sabotaging beliefs the narcissist has trained us to believe in. It perpetuates the vicious cycle. When we feel alone and abandoned, we’re less likely to know we deserve better.</p><p><strong>4. Self-sabotaging.</strong> Narcissists program you to self-destruct. They subject you to <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2016/06/20-diversion-tactics-highly-manipulative-narcissists-sociopaths-and-psychopaths-use-to-silence-you/">cruel insults</a>, harsh put-downs, <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2018/02/the-art-of-the-narcissists-subtle-sabotage-how-predators-set-up-disarm-and-destroy-their-victims/">subtle sabotage</a> and taunt you with perceived flaws, manufactured insecurities and a hyperfocus on your shortcomings. By doing this, they commit covert murder with clean hands. You’re so taken aback by their attacks that you suffer from anxiety about your competence, your skill sets and even your God-given talents.</p><p><strong>Why? Because the narcissist has convinced you that all your strengths are actually weaknesses.</strong> They do this on purpose to rob you of your sense of confidence and independence. Once you believe all the cruel things they say about you, you’ll start to sabotage yourself in the areas you naturally flourish in. When you catch yourself sabotaging yourself or engaging in negative self-talk, always ask yourself, “Do I really believe this about myself? Or is this what the narcissist wants me to believe?”</p><p><strong>5. Being people-pleasing and perfectionistic.</strong> Every time the narcissist criticized you, they planted seeds of self-doubt which burgeoned into full-blown insecurities after the relationship ended. You did everything to please your abuser to gain their approval or even just a moment of peace from their crazymaking. So it’s no surprise that when the relationship has ended, the pattern of trying to please people remained. People-pleasing and perfectionism are survival mechanisms that developed early on so that you could try to ward off any form of violence (be it physical or emotional). So long as the abuser approved of you (even just temporarily), you felt in the clear.</p><p>The challenge in the aftermath is to become the observer of your perfectionistic tendencies as well as your habit of people-pleasing. Instead of judging these habits, mindfully observe your thoughts and feelings whenever you’re tempted to do something that is not authentic to who you really are.</p><p>Ask yourself, “Why am I really doing this? What do I think I have to gain?” Examine the root of each compulsion as it arises and find a healthier alternative that honors what you really want and what you desire. To start overcoming needless perfectionism, start to self-validate and approve of yourself. When you’ve done something well, give yourself some healthy praise instead of waiting for someone else to validate it for you. Habits can be hard to break, but new habits can form to replace destructive ones.</p><p><strong>6. Withdrawing from others and isolating yourself.</strong> Abusers isolate you so you begin to isolate yourself as well. The narcissist is so charming and likeable that they are able to depict themselves as the sane ones while they <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2018/02/why-do-people-believe-narcissists-rather-than-their-victims/">provoke their victims</a> into becoming unhinged. With a perceived lack of support from others, you start to feel as if you have no one there to help you. Your body, mind and spirit is reeling from the trauma and is trying to process it.</p><p>Although a period of hibernation is normal after abuse and sometimes much needed to begin the healing process, don’t isolate yourself from professional support or validating people who understand what you’re going through. Reach out to those who can help you, those who’ve been there and those who have a solid understanding of what narcissistic abuse feels like.</p><p><strong>7. Falling into abuse amnesia.</strong> When the narcissist tells you they miss you, you’ll start to romanticize the relationship. When the narcissist shows good behavior, you’ll be tempted to fall into <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2016/12/five-ways-we-rationalize-abuse-and-why-we-need-to-stop/">“abuse amnesia”</a> as a coping strategy and rationalize that they were good, upstanding partners all along. You might fall prey to their “hoovering” attempts to get you back into the abusive relationship.</p><p>To counter abuse amnesia, it’s important to have a list of abusive incidents or at the very least, behaviors you experienced with this person. This will help you to reconnect to the reality of the abuse and keep you grounded in what you experienced. Confiding in a therapist and/or a trustworthy friend can also help to increase social accountability; when you find yourself rewriting the abuse, they’ll be there to help you get back on track and remind you of what you’re <em>not</em> missing out on.</p><p><strong>8. Protecting your abuser.</strong> Being abused means that we become <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2017/11/this-powerful-manipulation-method-keeps-you-bonded-to-your-abuser/">trauma-bonded</a> to the abuser. This is very much like Stockholm Syndrome; we were taken emotionally “hostage” by this predator and we’ve learned how to protect them, defend them and cater to them in order to survive. That is why survivors often feel compelled to talk about how happy the relationship is, even when they are suffering behind closed doors.</p><p>That is also why survivors of narcissists may not come forward right away to friends and family members about the abuse; they fear that they are overreacting, too sensitive, or imagining things, just like the abuser has told them. Even after you break free of a narcissist, you might still be prone to protecting the abuser’s image at the risk of your own welfare.</p><p>This can manifest in many different ways, from the major to the minor. You might refuse to cooperate with law enforcement on revealing the details of abuse or become argumentative with loved ones who call out the abuse for what it is. You might refuse to get an order of protection even if the narcissist is stalking or harassing you, for fear of retaliation as well as a warped sense of loyalty you developed to the narcissist during the relationship.</p><p>When fighting the urge to protect the abuser, remember that the abuser never protected you. They never protected you from the pain they inflicted upon you or the consequences that came with it. Your only duty after leaving an abusive relationship is to protect yourself, first and foremost.</p><p><strong>9. Having a warped sense of boundaries.</strong> One of the effects of being abused is that our boundaries become extremely malleable. We’re more compelled to say “yes” to things we desperately want to say “no” to. We’ve lost our sense of agency and control over our lives, so it takes time to rebuild our boundaries and reclaim our power. It helps to remember your <a href="http://pete-walker.com/humanBillofRights.htm" target="_blank">basic human rights</a> after you’ve been violated. These include the right to say no, the right to protest unfair behavior or mistreatment, and the right to feel angry and express it non-abusively.<strong> </strong></p><p>You can also create a list of emotional and physical boundaries you commit to honoring in the future with any relationship or friendship. These are customized to your needs can include boundaries like, “I don’t tolerate anyone lying to me” and “I don’t respond to threats or ultimatums.”</p><p>Take small steps to practice your new boundaries and follow through with them. When a toxic person tries to put you down, stand up for yourself in whatever way you can – even if it just means walking away from the interaction. Being assertive doesn’t always require a grand gesture – it just requires your willingness to prioritize your safety and wellbeing. When a friend tries to take advantage of you, start calling them out – even if it’s just in a polite but firm manner. Start asking yourself every day whether you’re doing something to please someone else or because you really want to do it.</p><p>It takes practice, but you <em>will</em> get there. No matter what you are struggling with now, you <em>can</em> reclaim your life and your power after being abused by a narcissist. In fact, you can thrive. <img src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p>]]>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 11 min<p>--------------------------------------------------<br />
please visit my new page:</p>
<p><a href="http://pro-toolz.net/">http://pro-toolz.net</a></p>
<p>you wont regret it ... ;-)<br />
--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Have you ever try to write some fancy output that will knock off your co-workers?<br />
Yes you will say, no problem, but have you used Bash to do that?<br />
Have you ever tried to do some menus and graphics under bash?<br />
Yes you will say again, 'dialog' is the right choice for such a task.<br />
But I am very stubborn and I want pure Bash, no external programs, but still some menus and graphics,<br />
and if possible no external programs at all.<br />
And I want at least so much capabilities to be able to build a simple boxes with some colored text.<br />
Is it possible?<br />
Well if you tried to do you homework, you definitely came to some<br />
death end, because bash manual page is not very explanatory on that issue.<br />
But I want to have some old-style text-mode graphics, menus and perhaps message boxes.<br />
And I want to be able to put text where-ever I want on my console.<br />
You would be surprised if I tell you, that most of that can be done with a simple 'echo'<br />
command which is also Bash-builtin.<br /></p>
<h5>How I did it</h5>
A few years ago my boss tried to convince me that curses library is the only<br />
possible option to produce something fancy on my terminal. But once I opened RedHat's<br />
/etc/init.d/functions file and extracted option for positioning characters at<br />
the current line but at the custom column. I thought - if this is possible, what<br />
else can be done with this nice echo command?<br />
My next step was to run RedHat Setup program and redirect it to an ordinary text file.<br />
That one took me some time. What I've got was a bunch of unreadable characters<br />
that should be responsible for drawing something to the screen. But how? I was confused<br />
for many months. No documentation available or I just did not know how to search for it.<br />
Then I played around with different options the way I deleted part by part of 'garbage' file<br />
produced with some tui aplication outputs and I found out how to switch between<br />
writing and drawing mode at the command line. That one was a real break on my<br />
path of creating some simple pure Bash menu lines.<br />
At the end I redirected some ncurses programs to an empty file and observed what happened.<br />
I ofcource tried many other combinations that work on some terminals, but below is<br />
my result, that should work on most terminal emulators used today.<br />
So, yes you will also need terminal emulator, that supports codes below.<br />
I tested all that stuff on putty and at the Linux console.<br /><h5>Step by step</h5>
Right here before you are some not very self-explanatory,<br />
small and usefull functions.<br />
But do not worry, I will explain everything to you.<br />
I will also show you step by step, how you can make those<br />
functions usefull for fancy bash programming.<br /><h5>The Power of echo command</h5>
We will start with a simple echo.<br />
Echo can be as powerfull as you can't even imagine.<br />
Just use it with an 'escape' character and extended<br />
option and it will print for you allmost anything.<br />
This 'echo' commad is also bash internal, builtin.<br />
So things just could not get any better.
<h5>Creating Custom ESCAPE character</h5>
It is mentioned in many manual pages but I did not understood the meaning<br />
of it at he beginning. With the simple words: to make<br />
some characters behave special way, you should put an ESC character infront<br />
of them. ESC character is a single character that takes two places. So it<br />
is impossible just to enter it over keyboard. This is known 'echo' feature and<br />
makes echo a very powerfull command.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033"
</pre>
<br /><h5>Creating Custom Function CLEAR</h5>
For start we need a clean screen to work on.<br />
Replacement for 'tput clear' can be simply performed<br />
just by executing 'clear' command.<br />
But I want to be sure just to use bash internals.<br />
So I created a simple echo command, that produces screen erasing.<br />
Escape character in combination with 'c' character will do the work for us.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033c"
</pre>
<h5>Creating Custom Function CIVIS</h5>
To create programs with a more realistic look, sometimes it<br />
is nice to hide cursor character.<br />
Replacement for 'tput civis' is reverse engineered.<br />
I typed tput civis and redirected an output to an ordinary text file.<br />
Then I looked inside using vi editor. And here it is.<br />
It will hide your cursor just as good as a real 'tput civis'.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033[?25l"
</pre>
<h5>Creating Custom Function CNORM</h5>
Replacement for 'tput cnorm' was created with the same method as command above.<br />
Its function is to make cursor visiible again.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033[?12l\033[?25h"
</pre>
<h5>Creating Custom Function TPUT</h5>
Replacement for 'tput cup' should put your cursor anywhere on your terminal.<br />
This can be also easily performed using syntax: echo -en "\033[10:10H".<br />
But since I want to be able to specify my own x and y coordinates I am using<br />
positional parameters ${1} and ${2} which will save my custom console input<br />
and transform it into something usefull.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033[${1};${2}H"
</pre>
<h5>Custom Function COLPUT</h5>
RedHat function for column put. This one was hacked from RedHat functions file.<br />
Function is responsible for start writing at the exact position on the current<br />
line without calculating in which line is cursor currently positioned. RedHat<br />
is using it to display services statuses at startup process.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033[${1}G"
</pre>
<h5>Custom Function MARK</h5>
Replacement for 'tput smso' should reverse background color around typed text.<br />
I found it the way I simply tested all numbers from 0 to 50. Some were very<br />
interesting but this was the only one more or less working on most terminal<br />
emulators.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033[7m"
</pre>
<h5>Custom Function UNMARK</h5>
Replacement for 'tput rmso' that returns selected text back to<br />
normal is created as easily as previous function.<br />
All you need to change is background color back to default (27m).<br />
The code below will do the trick:<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033[27m"
</pre>
<h5>Custom Function DRAW</h5>
This one along with function DRAW I discovered trying out a bunch of code, that RedHat's<br />
'setup' creates when output is redirected into a file.<br />
When I was seeking for a decend background coloring piece, some garbage came to my screen.<br />
I did not realise at first what this is good for and I thougt it is some console bug.<br />
But after short test it became clear to me that this garbage is actually simple line<br />
drawing and will be very usefull. To be sure to work also on other linux distributions with<br />
some different terminal settings, some RedHat's black magic '<strong>%@</strong>' is needed. This<br />
will load default console font with special characters that you will need to draw<br />
lines. If not done so, small case characters could be interpreted wrongly. So now we need<br />
to combine 'font switching' and 'draw' mode as two separated commands. I tried to combine<br />
them into one, and so can you, but sometimes the result is not satisfactory.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033%@";echo -en "\033(0"
</pre>
<h5>Custom Function WRITE</h5>
When I found 'drawing' mode I also wanted a simple 'return to writing' mode.<br />
Painfull testing method followed.<br />
I tried all letters and numbers and I succeeded!<br />
A very short code below will switch from so called 'garbaged' console back to normal.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033(B"
</pre>
<h5>Custom Function BLUE</h5>
To be short I just named it blue.<br />
But it can be easily turned into some other background color.<br />
Search for string <strong>44m</strong> and replace it with some of strings listed below.<br />
Result should be impressive.<br />
If not, your terminal does not support this kind of coloring.<br />
What I did is actually very simple.<br />
I reset screen (<strong>\033c</strong>), I set white color for font and<br />
blue for background (<strong>[37;44m</strong>) and at the end<br />
I want to apply all of this to the whole screen not only<br />
to my current row (<strong>[J</strong>).<br />
Select the following codes: <strong>40m</strong> for black, <strong>41m</strong> for red,<br /><strong>42m</strong> for dark green, <strong>43m</strong> for light green, <strong>44m</strong> for blue,<br /><strong>45m</strong> for pink, <strong>46m</strong> for green and <strong>47m</strong> for gray.<br /><pre class="code">echo -en "\033c\033[1;44m\033[J"
</pre>
<br /><h5>Putting it all together</h5>
Here is an example of how to create a true bash functions.<br />
To be always ready, put those function (or the ones you need)<br />
to the start of your every bash script.<br />
This way you will fasten your fancy Bash coding.<br /><pre class="code">ESC(){ echo -en "\033";}                            # escape character
 CLEAR(){ echo -en "\033c";}                           # the same as 'tput clear'
 CIVIS(){ echo -en "\033[?25l";}                       # the same as 'tput civis'
 CNORM(){ echo -en "\033[?12l\033[?25h";}              # the same as 'tput cnorm'
  TPUT(){ echo -en "\033[${1};${2}H";}                 # the same as 'tput cup'
COLPUT(){ echo -en "\033[${1}G";}                      # put text in the same line as the specified column
  MARK(){ echo -en "\033[7m";}                         # the same as 'tput smso'
UNMARK(){ echo -en "\033[27m";}                        # the same as 'tput rmso'
  DRAW(){ echo -en "\033%@";echo -en "\033(0";}        # switch to 'garbage' mode
 WRITE(){ echo -en "\033(B";}                          # return to normal mode from 'garbage' on the screen
  BLUE(){ echo -en "\033c\033[0;1m\033[37;44m\033[J";} # reset screen, set background to blue and font to white
</pre>
<h5>Some real life examples using functions above</h5>
Now you have all those functions but you still do not know<br />
how to use them? Let me start with some nice examples and<br />
show you some nice tricks.<br /><h5>Box with a simple progress indicator</h5>
<br /><table class="c2"><tbody><tr><td align="center">
<table class="c1"><tbody><tr><td>
<p> EXECUTING IN PROGRESS:     /    </p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><br />
Example shown above can be used in any program that will<br />
take some time to execute.<br />
Code will perform the following tasks:<br /><ol><li>clear screen (optional)</li>
<li>paint screen (optional)</li>
<li>hide cursor</li>
<li>enable drawing mode</li>
<li>draw fancy box</li>
<li>put text into box</li>
<li>put progress indicator into box</li>
<li>create mechanizm to be able to stop execution</li>
<li>make some space for real program execution</li>
<li>enable writing mode again</li>
<li>put rotating sign always at the same place on the screen</li>
<li>stop screen activity and return the cursor back to visible mode</li>
</ol><p>If you start your code from putty, you should get result similar to the one above.<br />
You will be able to observe rotating cursor for about five seconds. As you can see<br />
there is not too much of code needed (only 42 lines). Give special attention to the<br />
line with a '<strong>trap</strong>' command. This one is needed to prevent our script getting<br />
out of control. When you press ctrl+c or some other interrupt combination, 'trap'<br />
will also delete controlling file '/tmp/.waiting' and force subscript to stop.</p>
<p>As you can see a lot of '<strong>q</strong>' and some other characters are used. Those characters<br />
will draw some lines inside "drawing" mode for you. To see other characters, switch<br />
to drawing mode and try them out:</p>
<p>Only small case characters will draw something for you.<br />
But if you press large case character it will just present itself as a normal character.<br />
Since screen that looks like a garbage can cause a little panic with you. To be sure, that<br />
you have everything under control, just type '<strong>reset</strong>' and it will normalize screen for you again.</p>
<p>Characters shown above should be supported by most terminal emulators. But on some terminals<br />
you will also be able to to get more "drawing" characters to your screen. This way you will also<br />
make your program more terminal dependable. So just try to stick with characters shown above.</p>

<p>Storage is normally the slowest part of a system, and operating systems such as Linux try to limit I/O access with “tricks” like caching. The I/O scheduler may also matter if you have multiple programs accessing the same drive, and in <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2017/07/03/linux-4-12-release-main-changes-arm-mips-architectures/">Linux 4.12</a> implemented two new multi-queue block I/O schedulers, namely BFQ (Budget Fair Queuing) and Kyber that are meant to improve the performance of the systems. If you’re using <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2019/07/11/linux-5-2-release-main-changes-arm-mips-risc-v-architectures/">Linux 5.2</a> you may even get further improvements since performance tweaks make application start-up times under load to be up to 80% faster.</p>
<p>I have never seen BFQ in action so far, but earlier this year, Paolo Valente, who is working for Linaro, made a video with an Acer Chromebook 15 showing Google Chrome launch time using the default mq-deadline schedule, and bfq-mq scheduler.</p>
<p>The test involves writing a 1.5GB file to the drive with dd, and clicking on the Google Chrome icon to start it up. With the mq-deadline scheduler, it takes several seconds to launch Chrome, while with bqf-mq the launch is almost instantaneous.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2bREYTe0-0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen">[embedded content]</iframe></p>
<p>Some noted he did not clear the cache for the second run with the BFQ scheduler, but Paolo explained it did not matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first place I executed this test dropping caches, then found out that results are invariant w.r.t. dropping or not dropping. So, for fear of being too pedantic, I didn’t take the dropping step any longer in the version of the test I recorded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing a demo is all well and good, but I’d like to enable it on my systems to see how it performs. I’m running Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS with Linux 5.0.0.<br /></p>

We’re good to go. I haven’t done much testing yet. I’ll provide some feedback after playing around a bit more. If you have already checked it out, please do comment about your experience.</p>
<p>It may also be worthwhile to read “Best I/O scheduler to use” from the Ubuntu Wiki page linked above, as “deadline” is the recommended scheduler for basically all use cases.</p>

"Block" and "character" are misleading names for device types. The important distinction is that unbuffered "character" devices provide direct access to the device, while buffered "block" devices are accessed through a buffer which can greatly improve performance. Contradicting their common names, "character" devices can enforce block boundaries, and you can read or write "block" devices in blocks of any size including one byte at a time.</p><p>The operating system uses RAM for both <em>write buffer</em> and <em>read cache.</em> The idea is that data to be stored is written into the write buffer, where it can be sorted or grouped. A mechanical disk needs its data sorted into order so a sequence of write operations can happen as the arm moves in one direction across the platter, instead of seeking back and forth and greatly increasing overall time. If the storage system is RAID, then the data should be grouped by RAID stripe so that one stripe can be written in one operation.</p><p>As for reading, recently-read file system data is stored in RAM. If the blocks are "clean", unmodified since the last read, then the data can be read directly from cache RAM instead of accessing the much slower mechanical disks. Reading is made more efficient by appropriate decisions about which blocks to store and which to discard.</p></section><section><h2>Disk Queuing Algorithms</h2><p>Pending I/O events are scheduled or sorted by a queuing algorithm also called an <em>elevator</em> because analogous algorithms can be used to most efficiently schedule elevators. There is no single best algorithm, the choice depends some on your hardware and more on the work load.</p><p>Tuning is done by disk, not by partition, so if your first disk has partitions containing <code>/</code>, <code>/boot</code>, and <code>/boot/efi</code>, all three file systems must be handled the same way. Since things under <code>/boot</code> are needed only infrequently after booting, if ever, then consider your use of your root partition to select an algorithm for all of <code>/dev/sda</code>. This foreshadows the coming file system discussion where we want to limit the I/O per physical device.</p><p>Tuning is done with the kernel object <code>/sys/block/sd*/queue/scheduler</code>. You can read its current contents with <code>cat</code> or similar. The output lists all queuing algorithms supported by the kernel. The one currently in use is surrounded by square brackets.</p><pre>
# grep . /sys/block/sd*/queue/scheduler
/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler:noop deadline [cfq] 
/sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler:noop deadline [cfq] 
/sys/block/sdc/queue/scheduler:noop deadline [cfq] 
/sys/block/sdd/queue/scheduler:noop deadline [cfq] </pre><p>You can modify the kernel object contents and change the algorithm with <code>echo</code>.</p><pre>
# cat /sys/block/sdd/queue/scheduler 
noop deadline [cfq] 
# echo deadline &gt; /sys/block/sdd/queue/scheduler 
# cat /sys/block/sdd/queue/scheduler 
noop [deadline] cfq
</pre><p class="caption fr c1">If you're looking for information on the Anticipatory I/O scheduler, you are using some old references. <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7724/">It was removed</a> from the 2.6.33 kernel.</p><p><strong>The shortest explanation: Use Deadline for interactive systems and NOOP for unattended computation.</strong> But read on for details on why, and other parameters to tune.</p></section><section><h3>Deadline Scheduler</h3><p>The <strong>deadline</strong> algorithm attempts to limit the maximum latency and keep the humans happy. Every I/O request is assigned its own deadline and it should be completed before that timer expires.</p><p>Two queues are maintained per device, one sorted by sector and the other by deadline. As long as no deadlines are expiring, the I/O requests are done in sector order to minimize head motion and provide best throughput.</p><p><strong>Reasons to use the deadline scheduler include:</strong></p><p><strong>1: People use your system interactively.</strong> Your work load is dominated by interactive applications, either users who otherwise may complain of sluggish performance or databases with many I/O operations.</p><p>2: Read operations happen significantly more often than write operations, as applications are more likely to block waiting to read data.</p><p>3: Your storage hardware is a SAN (Storage Area Network) or RAID array with deep I/O buffers.</p><p>Red Hat uses deadline by default for non-SATA disks starting at RHEL 7. IBM System z uses deadline by default for all disks.</p></section><section><h3>CFQ Scheduler</h3><p>The <strong>CFQ</strong> or Completely Fair Queuing algorithm first divides processes into the three classes of Real Time, Best Effort, and Idle. Real Time processes are served before Best Effort processes, which in turn are served before Idle processes. Within each class, the kernel attempts to give every thread the same number of time slices. Processes are assigned to the Best Effort class by default, you can change the I/O priority for a process with <code>ionice</code>. The kernel uses recent I/O patterns to anticipate whether an application will issue more requests in the near future, and if more I/O is anticipated, the kernel will wait even though other processes have pending I/O.</p><p>CFQ can improve throughput at the cost of worse latency. Users are sensitive to latency and will not like the result when their applications are bound by CFQ.</p><p><strong>Reasons to use the CFQ scheduler:</strong></p><p><strong>1: People do not use your system interactively, at least not much.</strong> Throughput is more important than latency, but latency is still important enough that you don't want to use NOOP.</p><p><strong>2: You are not using XFS.</strong> <a href="http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q:_I_want_to_tune_my_XFS_filesystems_for_.3Csomething.3E">According to xfs.org</a>, the CFQ scheduler defeats much of the parallelization in XFS.</p><p>Red Hat uses this by default for SATA disks starting at RHEL 7. <em>And</em> they use XFS by default...</p></section><section><h3>NOOP Scheduler</h3><p>The <strong>NOOP</strong> scheduler does nothing to change the order or priority, it simply handles the requests in the order they were submitted.</p><p>This can provide the best throughput, especially on storage subsystems that provide their own queuing such as solid-state drives, intelligent RAID controllers with their own buffer and cache, and Storage Area Networks.</p><p>This usually makes for the worst latency, so it would be a poor choice for interactive use.</p><p><strong>Reasons to use the noop scheduler include:</strong></p><p><strong>1: Throughput is your dominant concern, you don't care about latency.</strong> Users don't use the system interactively.</p><p><strong>2: Your work load is CPU-bound: most of the time we're waiting for the CPU to finish something, I/O events are relatively small and widely spaced.</strong></p><p>Both of those suggest that you are doing high-throughput unattended jobs such as data mining, scientific high-performance computing, or rendering.</p></section><section><h3>Tuning the Schedulers</h3><p class="c2">Recall (or <a href="https://cromwell-intl.com/open-source/sysfs.html">learn here</a>) that Sysfs is the hierarchy under <code>/sys</code> and it maps internal kernel constructs to a file system so that:</p><ul class="c3"><li>Directories represent kernel objects,</li>
<li>Files represent attributes of those objects, and</li>
<li>Symbolic links represent relationships (usually identity) between objects</li>
</ul><p>Different files (attributes) appear in the <code>queue/iosched</code> subdirectory (object) when you change the content (setting) of the <code>queue/scheduler</code> file (attribute). It's easier to look at than to explain. The directories for the disks themselves contain the same files and subdirectories, including the file <code>queue/scheduler</code> and the subdirectory <code>queue/iosched/</code>:</p><pre>

logical_block_size   nr_request </pre><p>Let's assign three different schedulers and see what tunable parameters appear in their <code>queue/iosched</code> subdirectories:</p><pre>
# echo cfq &gt; /sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler 
# echo deadline &gt; /sys/block/sdc/queue/scheduler 
# echo noop &gt; /sys/block/sdd/queue/scheduler

/sys/block/sdc/queue/iosched/:
fifo_batch  front_merges  read_expire  write_expire  writes_starved
/sys/block/sdd/queue/iosched/: </pre><p>So we see that the cfq scheduler has twelve readable and tunable parameters, the deadline scheduler has five, and the noop scheduler has none (which makes sense as it's the not-scheduler).</p></section><section><h4>Tuning The CFQ Scheduler</h4><p>Remember that this is for mostly to entirely non-interactive work where latency is of lower concern.

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 5 min<p>For decades people have claimed disturbing encounters with supernatural humanoids that, despite looking very different, all have one thing in common: their crazy smiles. Collectively, they are <a href="http://www.theparanormalguide.com/blog/grinning-man">known as the Grinning Man</a>. They include paranormal clowns that haunt peoples’ bedrooms, ancient woods, and areas of paranormal activity. Then, there are the supernaturally Smiley-Faced ghouls who have been linked to mysterious deaths and disappearances in the United States. As for Indrid Cold, he is an enigmatic character who played a significant role in the Mothman wave that dominated Point Pleasant, West Virginia from 1966 to 1967. Cold’s <a href="https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4367">crazed and eerie grin</a> never left him, something which provoked fear among those who encountered him. He still occasionally surfaces to this day – much to the cost of those who cross his path.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hat-Man-True-Story-Encounters/dp/0983040192/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=heidi+hollis+hat+man&amp;qid=1569526709&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">The Hat Man is a</a> Man in Black-type being that appears in shadowy form; not unlike the infamous Shadow People – to whom the Hat Man is almost certainly related. On many occasions, however, the Hat Man appears in regular, human form, with a black beard and a black suit, and wearing a long overcoat or a cloak – always black, too. Most noticeable about this creepy figure is, of course, his hat. Sometimes, it’s a fedora, other times it’s an old style top hat. Occasionally, it’s more like a cowboy hat. But, regardless of the kind of headgear, it’s always present and always black. Many of the encounters occur while the victim is in a distinct altered state – that of sleeping.</p>
<p>Angie had just such an encounter in Leominster, Massachusetts, on September 6, 1994, as she told me late on the evening of October 8, 2014. Her reason for contacting me was due to the fact that, quite out of the blue, she had suddenly begun to dream of the events of twenty years earlier – and dream of them almost every night for a couple of weeks. Very much like those people unfortunate enough to be confronted by the somewhat similar Slenderman, Angie was sleeping when the mysterious thing disturbed her sleep by manifesting in her bedroom and staring at her <a href="https://obscurban-legend.fandom.com/wiki/Grinning_Man">with a menacing grin</a> on its pale, ghoulish face. For a few moments, Angie was unable to move. As she finally broke the spell of paralysis, however, the Hat Man was gone.</p>

Paro was</a> a woman who had a number of bizarre, UFO-themed encounters in May 1967, in upstate New York. At the time, she was a host on Babylon, New York’s WBAB station. On one particular day Jaye decided to take a walk. It was barely dawn, and the town in which she lived was still shrouded in shadows. As she walked passed a particularly dark alley, a Woman in Black loomed into view, as if from nowhere, or from some nightmarish realm. Then, out of the blue, came a black Cadillac, the absolute calling card of the MIB and the WIB. It came to a screeching halt next to the two women, and out of one of the rear doors came an unsettling-looking character. It was a man dressed in a dark grey suit, with what was described as an “oriental” appearance, and who sported a disturbing, almost deranged, grin. The driver seemed almost identical in appearance. The man with the fearsome grin shook Jaye’s hand and said, “I am Apol.” Jaye said that holding Apol’s hand was like holding the hand of a cold corpse. Moving on to another case…</p>
<p>His name was <a href="https://paranormalpeopleonline.com/the-many-faces-of-the-derenberger-incident">Woodrow Derenberger</a>, but everyone called him “Woody.” It was shortly after 6:00 p.m. on an evening in November 1966, when Woody Derenberger was driving home from his job as a sewing machine salesman at J.C. Penny’s in Marietta, Ohio to his farmhouse in Mineral Wells, West Virginia. The ride home was overcast and dreary. It was misting a light rain. As Derenberger came up on the Intersection of I-77 and Route 47, he thought that a tractor trailer truck was tailgating him without its lights on, which was unnerving, so he swerved to the side of the road and much to his surprise, the truck appeared to take flight and seemed to roll across his panel truck. To his astonishment, what Derenberger thought was a truck was a charcoal-colored UFO without any lights on. It touched down and then hovered about 10 inches above the road. Much to Derenberger’s surprise a hatch opened and a man stepped out who was dressed in dark clothing and who had a “beaming smile.” There was something about that grin, however, that sent chills down Derenberger’s back. His (or its) <a href="https://themothman.fandom.com/wiki/Indrid_Cold">name was Indrid Cold</a>.</p>
<p>Paranormal <a href="http://www.othersidepodcast.com/blog/author/sunspotmike/">researcher Mike Huberty</a> shared the following with me: “There’s an area near Waukesha [Wisconsin], the Fox River; a river that runs through the city. When I was doing research on a series of drownings there, I found we had a bunch of unsolved deaths. They were called <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2019/01/09/drownings-conspiracy-theory-focus-new-tv-show/2501915002/">the smiley-faced murders</a>. First, it was all these young men – twenty, twenty-five years old – along the Mississippi River; they were mysteriously drowning. There were searches for them, and sometimes it was months before they were found. So, I wondered if there was anything like this on the Fox River. I found seventeen documented drownings in the Fox River. I made the connection between the drownings and the folklore of ‘the Water Man.’ He lives in a hidden lair in the deepest part of the rivers. He walks and talks like a normal man and has a cloak that is split in the back. But, the handkerchief that hangs out of his pocket is always dripping wet. The Water Man has hairs on its head – like tentacles – that will drag you into the water.”</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-149103" src="https://mysteriousuniverse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/head-152665_640.png" alt="" width="529" height="640" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><p>In the original Slavic tales, the Water Man – known within <a href="https://inthedarkair.wordpress.com/2015/10/05/malicious-myths-the-vodyanoy-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9/">Slavic legend as the Vodyanoy</a> – is an extremely dangerous creature; it’s one to be avoided at all costs possible. He is driven to entice people to the water’s edge, at which point those terrible tendrils will lunge forward and pull his hysterical, terrified victims into the depths of the river, pond, lake or stream in which the Vodyanoy lurks and slaughters. And, as it does so, it smiles wildly. Insanely, even.</p>
<p>Finally, in October 2016 <a href="https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2016/10/maybe-its-time-we-started-taking-americas-creepy-clown-panic-seriously/">Micah Hanks said</a>: “For weeks now, alleged reports of ‘creepy clowns’ have been appearing in various parts of the United States. While much of the supposed ‘clown craze’ could be chalked up to an urban legend in the making (or perhaps the continuation of an old one), the latest incidents in America’s ongoing panic suggest there could more substance to the reports than initially thought.”</p>]]>

</figure><p>Homes have a habit of harboring all sorts of nasty odors—cat litter, microwaved salmon, fly traps made from apple cider vinegar—that are blessedly easy to mitigate. Sometimes, though, you come across unpleasant smells that are harder to find and deodorize. Here are some common culprits, along with methods of attack.</p><h3 class="kbbplc-0 mmwhk"><strong>There’s hidden mold</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe you’ve noticed a “musty” or “wet cardboard” smell in your home. Or perhaps you’ve referred to it as “old home smell.” Either way, one of the most common causes of lingering, musty smells, especially in older homes, is hidden mold, usually in the walls.</p>

</div>
<p>As you probably know, some types of mold can be toxic. According to the <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.epa.gov/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA), most <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-cleanup-your-home&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-cleanup-your-home" target="_blank">household mold problems under 10 square feet</a> are safe enough to clean on your own and don’t need a professional, but to be safe, you should read up on the different types of mold at <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldguide.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.epa.gov/mold/moldguide.html" target="_blank">the EPA’s website here</a>.</p>
<p>Then, the first real order of business? Figure out where that mold might be hiding. Here are some common culprits:</p>
<ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet" class="sc-1lmbno3-0 eXGUJG"><li>Leaky plumbing</li>
<li>Gutter issues</li>
<li>Poor ventilation in kitchen and bathrooms</li>
<li>Window frames where condensation builds up</li>
</ul><p>For small, non-toxic mold problems, like the mold that accumulates on windowsills and frames, simply clean the mold with a soap and water solution, as instructed in the video. Vinegar or diluted bleach are also useful. Add it to water, then spray directly on the mold and clean up. For larger mold problems, you should call a professional.</p>
<p>Prevention is key with mold, and the <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://extension.missouri.edu/p/GH5928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://extension.missouri.edu/p/GH5928" target="_blank">University of Missouri Extension offers some easy tips</a> for keeping that nasty stuff at bay:</p>
<blockquote data-type="BlockQuote" class="sc-8hxd3p-0 jRhwXx">
<p>Keep closets, dresser drawers, basements — any place where mildew is likely to grow — as clean as possible. Soil on dirty articles can supply enough food for mildew to start growing when moisture and temperature are right. Greasy films, such as those that form on kitchen walls, also contain many nutrients for mildew-causing molds.</p>
<p>Spread a layer of moisture-barrier material over the soil in crawl spaces under houses. You can use heavy roofing paper or polyethylene plastic film. Good ventilation is important. If possible, do not enclose the crawl space. In extreme cases, a fan or blower may be needed to move the humid air from under the building.</p>
<p>In rooms that are not air-conditioned — especially the basement — mechanical dehumidifiers are useful. A humidistat can be attached to the unit to control the humidity. Mechanical dehumidifiers, however, can add heat to a room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take extra care in laundry rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, where moisture and humidity run amok.</p>
<h3 class="kbbplc-0 mmwhk"><strong>Your carpet and walls have absorbed years of stink</strong></h3>
<p>Carpets and paint can absorb bad smells over time: smoke, pet urine, spilled milk. I always <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://workshop.lifehacker.com/five-tips-to-make-painting-your-walls-easier-1632720076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://workshop.lifehacker.com/five-tips-to-make-painting-your-walls-easier-1632720076" target="_blank">splash a fresh coat of paint on the walls</a> when I move, and it typically gets rid of most lingering smells. If you’re renting, you might not be able to paint without getting your deposit back, so always check with your landlord first. At the very least, deep clean the walls, ceilings, and baseboards to get rid of as much of the stink as possible. Home Guides <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://homeguides.sfgate.com/remove-cigarette-smoke-smell-color-walls-91853.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://homeguides.sfgate.com/remove-cigarette-smoke-smell-color-walls-91853.html" target="_blank">offers a couple of different solutions</a> for getting rid of stubborn smells:</p>
<blockquote data-type="BlockQuote" class="sc-8hxd3p-0 jRhwXx">
<p><strong>The White Vinegar Solution</strong>: ...Start by adding warmed vinegar to a spray bottle for tough stains. Dilute using a one-to-one ratio with warm water for less noticeable stains. Apply the warmed vinegar or mixture directly to the walls. Because tar and nicotine develop a sticky and hardened surface, the warmth of the vinegar helps to soften these substances. Vinegar removes both smells and stains.</p>
<p><strong>The Ammonia Method</strong>: Ammonia can also remove cigarette tar and nicotine from walls when mixed with water. Combine a tablespoon of ammonia for every cup of water, or roughly 1/2 cup of ammonia to a gallon of warm water. For painted walls, reduce the mixture to 1/4 cup to a gallon of water. For a stronger solution, increase the ammonia to a full cup. Apply the cleaning agent directly to the wall and let it sit for about five minutes before wiping it off. Follow with a clean rinse of warm water.</p>

<p>For stains, we’ve also suggested a <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://lifehacker.com/bleach-away-water-stains-from-your-ceiling-1746211014#_ga=1.128747532.1268082208.1431441811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://lifehacker.com/bleach-away-water-stains-from-your-ceiling-1746211014#_ga=1.128747532.1268082208.1431441811">bleach and water mixture</a>. Don’t forget to replace the air filters in your home, too. They can also be stink traps.</p>

<p>Replacing your carpets is obviously the best solution for removing the odor they’ve absorbed over time, but that’s not realistic for most of us. It’s an expensive project, and if you’re a renter, your landlord might not comply. To remedy stinky carpets, sprinkle baking soda on them and let it sit for a while—perhaps even overnight. Then, thoroughly vacuum the carpet and the baking soda along with it. If that doesn’t get the job done, you might need a deeper clean. Rent a <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www6.homedepot.com/tool-truck-rental/Carpet_Cleaner/95371/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www6.homedepot.com/tool-truck-rental/Carpet_Cleaner/95371/" target="_blank">carpet cleaning machine</a> or steam cleaner. Typically, you fill it with cleaning solution (or <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://lifehacker.com/save-money-by-using-vinegar-in-rental-carpet-cleaners-5947670&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://lifehacker.com/save-money-by-using-vinegar-in-rental-carpet-cleaners-5947670">white vinegar and water</a> for a cheaper solution) then run the machine up and down your carpets, as you can see in the video above.</p>
<h3 class="kbbplc-0 mmwhk"><strong>Your dishwasher is filthy</strong></h3>
<p>Your dishwasher needs a simple cleaning every month or so, and it’s as easy as running the dishwasher empty with a cup of vinegar. Alternatively, you could sprinkle some baking soda across the bottom of the dishwasher and run it. The video above will show you how it’s done.</p>
<p>Beyond the basics, however, every dishwasher needs an occasional deep cleaning, and if yours smells like gross, old food, it’s probably high time for a scrub down. <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://lifehacker.com/clean-these-two-parts-of-your-dishwasher-to-keep-it-run-1529802430#_ga=1.128747532.1268082208.1431441811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://lifehacker.com/clean-these-two-parts-of-your-dishwasher-to-keep-it-run-1529802430#_ga=1.128747532.1268082208.1431441811">Focus on two areas</a>: the seals and the dishwasher trap.</p>

<p>Find the trap (or filter) under your dishwasher’s sprayer. If you haven’t cleaned it in a while, you might find scraps of food and other gunk. Sometimes the tray comes out so you can just rinse it in the sink. If not, you’ll need a towel to remove the gunk build-up.</p>
<p>Second, wipe down the rubber seal around the dishwasher door. Use a vinegar and water solution to get rid of any mold or buildup around the area.</p>
<h3 class="kbbplc-0 mmwhk"><strong>A dead animal is decomposing somewhere in your home </strong></h3>
<p>I’ve never (knock on wood) dealt with the reportedly pungent, sickly smell of a dead critter in my walls or ceilings, but from what I understand, it’s tough to ignore.<br /></p>
<p>Most likely, the smell will be knock-you-out strong in one particular area, and that should be able to help you identify the source, whether it’s in the attic, basement, or some specific wall. Wildlife Removal <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.wildlife-removal.com/deadanimal.htm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.wildlife-removal.com/deadanimal.htm" target="_blank">points to some common areas</a>:</p>
<ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet" class="sc-1lmbno3-0 eXGUJG"><li><strong>The attic</strong>: It can be tricky to find the culprit in the attic because it might be buried under the insulation. They explain that when an animal dies in the attic, it’s common for the smell to permeate the whole house.</li>
<li><strong>The wall</strong>: Yep, sometimes animals live in your walls or fall down in them and get stuck and die. Experts sniff out the spot, cut a hole, remove the carcass, and patch it up.</li>
<li><strong>The chimney</strong>: It’s rare, but it can happen, particularly if you have a metal chimney flue that the animals can’t climb out of.</li>
<li><strong>Under the house</strong>: Animals of all kinds—raccoons, opossums, and even cats—often live under elevated houses and die in the crawl space.</li>
</ul>
<p>They add that people often think there’s a dead animal in their ductwork, but that’s actually very rare. Usually, it’s just the airflow stirring up the smell.

<blockquote data-type="BlockQuote" class="sc-8hxd3p-0 jRhwXx">
<p>If you are able to remove the animal carcass you will be able to eliminate the odor quickly by using products like Bac-A-Zap or Odor Hunter that utilize enzymes to break down the offending odor-carrying molecules. These products should be sprayed onto the area (or as close to the area as possible) where the odor originated from to be effective. You may also use the Earth Care Odor Remover Bags. These bags are simply hung up in smelly rooms and as the air in the room passes through the bag, the odor is removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the carcass is in an inaccessible area, bring in a pro. Call your local pest control or wildlife removal company to help you identify the location and remove the source and clean up the area. If you have the DIY skills, you could try it on your own, though. In the above video, wildlife control specialist Shinya Coulter removes sheetrock from inside of a closet to get to a dead rodent (thankfully, Coulter doesn’t show it), then he simply patches up the hole, which we’ve shown you <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://workshop.lifehacker.com/how-to-patch-a-hole-in-drywall-1619162567#_ga=1.128747532.1268082208.1431441811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://workshop.lifehacker.com/how-to-patch-a-hole-in-drywall-1619162567#_ga=1.128747532.1268082208.1431441811" target="_blank">how to do here</a>.</p>

<p>Sewage and rotten eggs share a similar putrid aroma, and a rotten egg smell might indicate a gas leak, which is a lot more dangerous. If you smell rotten eggs and you suspect it might be a gas leak, exit the area, make sure not to turn on any lights or use anything ignitable, then call your gas company. <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.pge.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.pge.com/" target="_blank">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</a> offers <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.pge.com/en/safety/gaselectricsafety/gasodorpilot/index.page&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.pge.com/en/safety/gaselectricsafety/gasodorpilot/index.page" target="_blank">a more detailed gas safety guide here</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that, if one part of your home—typically the bathroom—just smells like sewage, it might just be a dried up <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_(plumbing)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_(plumbing)" target="_blank">P-trap</a>.</p>
<p>P-traps are designed to trap water in the pipe, creating a seal that prevents sewer gas from leaking up through the sink or bathtub. If you haven’t used your sink in a while, the water in the P-trap evaporates, eliminating that barrier. In other words, sewage gas passes right on through, stinking up your bathroom. Similarly, gasses can escape when the water level in your toilet bowl drops. The remedy? Simply flush your toilet or run your sink or bathtub for a bit to clear the pipe.</p>
<p>In some cases, though, you might have a more serious problem in your sewer, drainage, or venting pipes. <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://homeguides.sfgate.com/stop-sewer-gas-entering-house-38627.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://homeguides.sfgate.com/stop-sewer-gas-entering-house-38627.html" target="_blank">As Home Guides explains</a>, your toilet could be cracked or your vent pipe could be clogged.

<h3 class="kbbplc-0 mmwhk"><strong>Your water heater needs maintenance </strong></h3>
<p>While you’re checking your P-traps, you may also want to check your hot water heater. As <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.watertechonline.com/replacing-anodes-getting-rid-of-odor/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.watertechonline.com/replacing-anodes-getting-rid-of-odor/" target="_blank">Water Tech Online explains</a>, In places where there’s a lot of sulfur in the water, the agent used to reduce the sulfur often reacts with the anode rod in the water heater.<br /></p>
<blockquote data-type="BlockQuote" class="sc-8hxd3p-0 jRhwXx">
<p>Replacing the standard anode with an aluminum/zinc anode, provided that no water softener is being used, often works in this situation because the reduced current of the anode will significantly reduce the amount of H2 gas generated in the tank.</p>

<p>Run your hot water and see if the smell is more prevalent. If so, you may need a new anode rod, which <a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.familyhandyman.com/plumbing/water-heater/extend-the-life-of-your-water-heater-by-replacing-the-anode-rod/view-all&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/plumbing/water-heater/extend-the-life-of-your-water-heater-by-replacing-the-anode-rod/view-all" target="_blank">experts suggest you replace every five years</a>, anyway. Just make sure to read your water heater’s warranty, because some of them require specific types of rods, otherwise the warranty could be voided.</p>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 3 min<div class="editableWrapper"><div><p>Every month, I consult with a variety of <a href="https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/blockchain-technology-is-set-to-disrupt-every-indu.html?cid=hmside4">entrepreneurs</a> and brands on their social media strategy. When I first meet with them, they always raise the concern that they are generating likes and followers on <a href="https://www.inc.com/sonya-mann/facebook-slower-growth-snapchat.html?cid=hmhero">social media</a>, but not a high enough percentage of them are actually being <a href="https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/inc5000-2017-5-biggest-industries-revenue.html?cid=hmsub2">converted into customers</a>.</p></div><div><p>The biggest hole in their strategy is often that they either are not using calls to action at all, or they are not using the right words to convince their followers to take the next step. Their customers simply don't know what to do next after reading a post.</p></div><div><p>People's attention spans are shorter than ever these days, and if your company doesn't have a compelling call to action in your posts, people will simply move on.</p></div><div><p>Here are several ways your company can create more effective calls to action increase traffic to your website and convert more followers into customers.</p></div><p></p><h2>Customers love to learn</h2><div><p>Research shows that people love to learn. It's one of the main reasons they come to the Internet. So when your company offers customers the opportunity to learn rather than an overt sales pitch, it increases the likelihood of them engaging with your post and going to your website.</p></div><div><p>This is the perfect opportunity to showcase that new blog post or video to educate your audience on something new that your company is involved in.</p></div><div><p>Here are the words to use to inspire your customers to want to learn more about your company and its products:</p></div><div><ul><li>Learn more here and get started toward...</li>
<li>Check out how this will help your company...</li>
<li>Discover this new way to...</li>
<li>Find out why so many companies are using this to improve their...</li>
</ul></div><p></p><h2>Sharing beats algorithms</h2><div><p>If you're like many out there, you don't have time to keep up with the latest tweaks the social media networks make in their algorithms. However, the one thing that will always remain constant when it comes to content being distributed to a wider network on social media is getting a lot of people to share it.</p></div><div><p>Asking your audience to share a piece of content can often result in more shares. However, to get results these days, you have to be more strategic than just saying "please share" or just putting "RT" in your tweets hoping people will retweet it.</p></div><div><p>Here are the words to use to get more shares of your content:</p></div><div><ul><li>If you are as passionate about this as we are, please help us spread the word about...</li>
<li>Share this if you agree with...</li>
<li>Share this and tell your friends what you think of...</li>
<li>Share this and show the world that you support...</li>
</ul></div><p></p><h2>Let your audience sound off</h2><div><p>In case you haven't noticed, people are eager to give an opinion these days. Savvy marketers are able to use this to evoke an emotional response from their audience.</p></div><div><p>While enabling your customers to give their opinions, you will get some negative feedback. However, it has been proven over and over that the most successful companies can use negative feedback to get over the hump with their products and make massive improvements to the customer experience.</p></div><div><p>I was reminded of this yet again by a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-product-piece-sht-how-feedback-changed-my-company-ryan-holmes">post on LinkedIn</a> from Hootsuite CEO Ryan Holmes. In the piece, he told the story of the time where a customer used a rather aggressive tone (that I won't repeat here) when describing Hootsuite's UI via a tweet directed at their customer support. Holmes credits that tweet as being the catalyst to moving Hootsuite's interface through the major revamp it needed to keep pace with their competitors.</p></div><div><p>To start more conversations with your audience, use these words:</p></div><div><ul><li>Our product team is fresh out of the lab, so tell us what you think about our new...</li>
<li>Tell your company's story about when you used...</li>
<li>Today we want to know what you think about...</li>
<li>What frustrates you the most about...</li>
<li>If it were all left up to you, how would you improve...</li>
<li>Today, we want to hear from our audience! Share your voice with us about...</li>
</ul></div><div><p>The words you choose matter, and having the right calls to action in your posts on social media will make all the difference. How does your company use calls to action on social media, and what have the results been like?</p></div></div><p>The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.</p>]]>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 9 min<img width="735" height="380" src="https://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/k-s1-74-working.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="blogging" srcset="https://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/k-s1-74-working.jpg 735w, https://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/k-s1-74-working-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.thebookdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/k-s1-74-working-348x180.jpg 348w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><p>Back in 2012 when I had been blogging for two years, I had gotten to know the blogging community pretty well through top sites for bloggers like <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/blog-archive-ebooks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Copyblogger</a>, which has since turned into a multi-faceted media and software company.</p><p>I was struck at the time by the almost total disconnect between authors, who were learning how to use the new tools of publishing to put their books out faster and with less risk than ever before, and bloggers, who often were sitting on massive archives of their own content.</p><p>The authors were learning what to do, but the bloggers simply had no clue that a revolution was happening, one that they could easily learn to take advantage of.</p><p>In that context, I contributed this article, which was addressed directly to the blogging community, to Copyblogger. I’ve updated it a bit, but honestly, it’s just as accurate as it was when it was first published. Enjoy.</p><hr /><p><em>Attention Bloggers: I’ve seen the future, and you’re missing it.</em></p><p>Oh sure, we bloggers think we’re the most up-to-date, leading-edge, tech-savvy people on the planet.</p><p>But one of the biggest changes in the long history of content creation is taking place right under your feet, and I’m afraid it may be passing you by.</p><p>Yep, the ground is shifting, fortunes are being made, and some of the people who could best profit from this tectonic shift — content producers — are mostly sitting on the sidelines.</p><p>Okay, what am I talking about? The revolution in book publishing.</p><p>Maybe you’ve heard some of the success stories of the authors who’ve been selling a ton of paranormal romances, thrillers or other genre novels on Amazon’s Kindle platform, but that’s not what I’m talking about.</p><p>You may have also heard about big-time authors like Barry Eisler, Steven King, Seth Godin and others leading the way in self-publishing. That’s not it either.</p><p>What I’m talking about is something bloggers are already expert in: niche publishing.</p><h3>Bloggers vs. authors</h3><p>Let’s back up for a minute. Have you ever thought about the similarities between self-publishing and blogging? Probably not, why would you?</p><p>But as a blogger who writes about indie book publishing, I think about this stuff all the time. And here’s what I see at this amazing moment in publishing:</p><p>Self-publishers and bloggers each have only half the equation for success in the new world of book publishing.</p><p>Take authors for example. Most are really good at things like producing long content (long as in 80,000 words), staying with a project for months or years without losing focus, and planning a complex project using freelance contractors.</p><p>The problem is, many authors are notorious loners, are often non-technical, they can go years without any contact with their readers, and their mindset may be completely rooted in the 19th century. Not only that, the typical author has no idea of what marketing actually means in the real world.</p><p>That might make a blogger feel pretty good about herself.</p><p>It’s true that bloggers stay in constant touch with their readers, know how to publish on a schedule, get constant feedback from readers, love to experiment via agile content, and are highly networked with other bloggers in their niche.</p><p>But niche market bloggers have obstacles to overcome, too.</p><p>They can fall into the trap of thinking 500 words at a time, with disjointed subjects littering their archives. After blogging for a while, they may lose sight of any overarching theme they started with.</p><p>Not only that, many bloggers treat their blogs as a “hobby”, or they’re focused on Adsense, affiliate sales and special promotions. Bloggers like to chase the “shiny new object,” fall into the social media time-sink very easily, and all too often rely exclusively on metrics as the measure of their success.</p><h3>Why book publishing makes sense for bloggers</h3><p>Here’s what you’ve been missing: you don’t have to be Amanda Hocking or Joe Konrath or John Locke (all of whom have sold a ton of ebook fiction) to get major, potentially life-changing results from book publishing.</p><p>This is the dirty little secret behind self-publishing that we’ve been hiding from the big publishers for years:</p><p>If you’re a writer with ready access to a niche audience, you’re probably much better off financially publishing your own book.</p><p>If you blog on a niche topic and know how to reach the people in that field, why give 85% of your profits to a big publisher in New York?</p><p>(If you’re Chris Brogan or Tim Ferriss writing for a mass consumer or mass business market, you might be better off with that big publisher. But if that’s not you, read on.)</p><h3>The blogger’s unfair advantage</h3><p>Okay, so you know how to meet deadlines, you publish on a schedule and you’re in touch with your readers. You’re already miles ahead of most self-published authors.</p><p>Is it really worth going through the trouble of learning how to publish books? Here are some outcomes that might stimulate you.</p><ul><li><strong>Authority</strong>—There’s a reason all those guests you see on TV are introduced as “author of …” There’s nothing that will supercharge the authority you have in your niche the way a book will, especially one with lots of testimonials from people your readers know and respect.</li>
<li><strong>Passive income</strong>—It’s better than ads in your sidebars, better than pay-per-click, and once your book is for sale in either print or ebook versions, the whole process is completely automatic.</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong>—Having a book to your name will spread your profile far beyond the circles you can reach with your blog.</li>
<li><strong>More opportunities</strong>—You are likely to get more offers for speaking gigs, joint ventures and co-authoring opportunities once you’re a published author.</li>
<li><strong>Stand out from the crowd</strong>—Is there another blogger in your niche who is also a published author? No? What’s stopping you?</li>
<li><strong>Back of the room sales</strong>—Another underutilized way to make money from your blog is by selling your book at live appearances, workshops or other events.</li>
</ul><p>But how do you make the leap from blogger to author? It can seem overwhelming when you compare the pile of posts in your archive to a neat and cohesive manuscript ready to publish.</p><p>Don’t despair; I’ve got three methods you can use, so read on to see which one appeals to you…<br /></p><h3>1. The site archive method</h3><p>Lots of bloggers ignore their archives, which is a shame.</p><p>We’re so concerned with the next post that we forget all the value we’ve built up over the months or years we’ve been blogging.</p><p>In this method you explore your archives for themes that keep reappearing, or for posts you wrote to answer the most common and compelling questions people keep coming up with in your niche. Your “pillar” or “evergreen” or “foundation” posts are going to come into play here.</p><p>Gather the posts you find that meet your criteria into sections, each one for a separate subject. These will eventually become the chapters in your book.</p><p>This is the method I used last year when I published A Self-Publisher’s Companion. Then I wrote an introduction for the book, added an up-to-date resource section and the book was done. How cool is that?</p><h3>2. The series method</h3><p>This is the opposite of the Archive method, because it means you’ll be writing the book as a series of blog posts or, more likely, as several series.</p><p>You’ll outline the book first. This doesn’t have to be difficult, just pick the subjects you want to cover and then divide them into chapters.</p><p>For example, your book might have 12 chapters, and each chapter could be about 5,000 words.</p><p>Create a blog post that looks at each aspect of your chapter. You’re now looking at a series of five 1,000-word articles. And don’t forget, blog post series are a great way to keep readers involved and coming back for more, so you’ll win both ways, as a blogger and an author.</p><p>Just keep writing those series of blog posts, and pretty soon your manuscript will be finished and ready to go.</p><h3>3. The big edit method</h3><p>In this method you’ll treat all posts as potential first draft material.</p><p>Although this takes the greatest amount of work, it has the potential to produce the best book from the copy you’ve already written.</p><p>Look through the content you already have, selecting the parts that work within the scheme of your book. You’ll be doing a ton of cutting-and-pasting as you assemble the bits you want to use.</p><p>Undoubtedly, you’ll need to write new material to create an effective manuscript that flows well from one subject to another. To use this method, you’ll probably also need to hire an editor to help shape and smooth out the manuscript.</p><p>The truth is, in the book world, hiring an editor is always a good idea.</p><p>Your book editor can be a powerful ally when it comes to creating a book people really want to buy.</p><h3>What’s next?</h3><p>Now, you’ve got a real book manuscript.</p><p>When I did this last year it took about 40 blog posts and a new introduction to create a 222-page trade paperback that sells for $14.95 (print) or $4.99 (ebook).</p><p>What’s the profit look like from those books? On sales at Amazon.com — after all discounts and manufacturing costs — my profit is $8.00 per paperback and $3.75 per ebook.</p><p>Getting interested? Want to know how to get started turning your archives into books? Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>The fastest way to get a book up for sale without the complications of formatting for print production is with an ebook.</li>
<li>These are ePub and Mobi ebooks, not PDF ebooks like the ones you give away on your blog.</li>
<li>You can convert your own files to ebooks with free software like <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Calibre</a> or with a tool like <a href="http://affiliates.esellerate.net/Affiliates/a.aspx?c=SKU28498557428_1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scrivener</a>, used by many ebook authors.</li>
<li>Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/apps/pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pages</a> outputs to ePub, and more tools like this are coming online constantly.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashwords.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Smashwords</a> will convert your book for free if you follow their formatting guidelines.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bookbaby.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BookBaby</a> offers great deals on ebook conversion and distribution to all major retailers at very low fees.</li>
<li>Lots of authors have reported good success with <a href="https://www.draft2digital.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Draft2Digital</a>, another popular service that helps authors publish ebooks.</li>
<li>Become part of the book scene by getting familiar with some of the big reader communities that are growing like crazy online. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>, <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wattpad</a>, and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scribd</a> are all new communities with millions of members that most bloggers have never even heard of.</li>
<li>Use your blogging schedule to plan out the article series that will become your book manuscript. For instance, you might want to have a special focus on your blog for the month, encouraging lots of discussion and interaction while you’re creating that specific part of your book.</li>
<li>Leverage your blogging network when it comes time to launch and promote your book. After all, you establish these connections to help market your blog. When your book comes out, it’s a great opportunity to “tour” the other blogs in your niche, exposing you to tons of new readers.</li>
</ul><h3>The time is now</h3><p>Well, there you have it.</p><p>No group of people is better situated than bloggers RIGHT NOW to take advantage of the historic movement to digital books and the exploding popularity of self-publishing.</p><p>Will you join the revolution?</p><p><span>Photo: <a href="https://www.rawpixel.com/" target="_blank">Rawpixel.com</a></span></p><p><span>This post originally appeared in a slightly different form on Copyblogger.com under the title <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/blog-archive-ebooks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">3 Simple Ways to Turn Your Website Archive into Profitable Books and eBooks</a></span></p>]]>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 8 min<p>“I’m going to write a novel” is a project that needs breaking down. Breaking it down separates the dreamers from the do-ers.</p><p>I’m going to single out some of the project management processes that I think will help you finish a manuscript. Just know a couple things:</p><p>1. This is not a substitute for actual project management training. People study this stuff for years. Think of this like me giving you a few cooking tips. Don’t run off and open a restaurant, but this’ll make your food at home a little better.</p><p>2. This is through the lens of me. Filtered through a writer, applied to the specific project of creating a manuscript, and adapted to be useful out of context with the vast system of project management. Don’t get all pissy with me if you feel like my version of these steps is simplistic or off. It’s meant to be useful to writers, not project managers.</p><h2>Is A Codified System The Enemy Of Creativity?</h2><p>Some people look at a business-oriented approach like project management as anti-creative. </p><p>Let's talk reality. The idea that you can just write “when the muse strikes” is kinda juvenile. I mean, sure, it works for some people. Chuck Palahniuk is famous for saying he doesn’t sit down in front of a blank sheet of paper unless he feels like writing, or, as he puts it, you don’t sit on the toilet when you don’t have to shit. But the thing is, he’s a unique guy. It seems like the urge to write hits him A LOT. Whether or not this means he takes a lot of shits is uncertain, but you need to ask yourself, if you wrote only when you felt inspired, how often would you write?</p><p>Also, think about efficiency. Ask any writer with a full-time job and a side hustle, any writer who has kids. If you codify and structure your creative process a bit, you spend less time remembering where you left off, worrying about peripheral concerns, and you can use what little time you have to get shit done.</p><h2>Develop Your Charter -or- Mountain</h2><p>In this case, I want a clear statement about what your project is. “Finish a Manuscript.”</p><p>This is your mountain, <a href="https://youtu.be/ikAb-NYkseI">as Neil Gaiman put it.</a> Gaiman said he thinks about his work as The Mountain. You see this Mountain in the distance, and whenever you have a decision to make, you think about The Mountain and ask yourself, “Does this option take me one step closer to the mountain, a step further away, or is this a lateral move?” If the answer is anything but a step closer, then it's a waste of time.</p><p>Write your charter/statement on a notecard, a sheet of paper, or a whiteboard. Live with it a few days. See if it fits. Then, declare it your Mountain.</p><h2>Define Scope</h2><p>Becoming famous, being commercially successful, farting FAR less, these are all legit projects, but they’re outside the scope of writing a manuscript.</p><p>If the charter outlines what your project is, the scope helps you figure out what your project isn’t.</p><p>Draw a circle around your charter statement. This represents your scope. As you move forward and have weird ideas, decide whether they fit inside or outside the circle.</p><p>For example, if your charter statement is “Complete a manuscript,” then “Become a famous novelist” doesn’t belong within the circle. Write it outside the circle. It can live there in fantasy world, outside this project.</p><p>“Write a book that lives up to expectations of my last book,” is another one that falls outside the scope of “Write a manuscript.” Write this outside the circle, remind yourself what you’re really doing.</p><p>Becoming famous, being commercially successful, farting FAR less, these are all legit projects, but they’re outside the scope of writing a manuscript. Eyes on the prize.</p><h2>Assets and Environment</h2><p>If your manuscript is your baby, this is where you consider the world you’re bringing this baby into. This is where you ask the tough question: Can this baby thrive in the current environment?</p><p>How many hours a day could you potentially devote to the project? What do you have that will help you in terms of hardware, software, STUFF in general? What is your experience/skill level? What is the general level of support within the culture of your organization (your household, your workplace, whatever). Are there laws that might help or hurt the project (can you qualify for a tax break on a home office?)? In the case of writing a book, how many hours are there in a day that are unusable because you’re sleeping, working, whatever?</p><p>This is a critical stage. Why? Because you need to look at what you’ve got and honestly decide whether you have what you need. Desire to write a book is great, but it’s not enough. Writing a book is a big deal. Don't start your hike towards the mountain without enough water to last you awhile.</p><h2>Estimating Activity Durations</h2><p>“How long should my rough draft take?” isn’t an easy question to answer, but that doesn’t mean you have to make up a bullshit number. Allow me to introduce the 3-Point Estimate or Average MOP, as I like to call it.</p><p>Start with your Most Likely. When, based on your historical output, do you think you’ll be done? 12 months? Call this M.</p><p><img alt="" class="imagecache-content-large c3" src="https://litreactor.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/content-large/images/column/2019/09/calculator-1683601920.jpg" title="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p><p>Then, give me an Optimistic. If everything went right, if the stars aligned and you cranked out 1,000 words a day, when would you finish? 9 months? Let’s call that O.</p><p>Pessimistic. If things go wrong, if  it took longer than you thought, what would that look like? 24 months? We’ll call this P.</p><p>Math time. Take your MOP (Most Likely, Optimistic, and Pessimistic), add them up, and average the total. This looks like (M + O + P) / 3. And no, this isn’t one of those idiotic online quizzes where you argue with people who don’t remember their order of operations. </p><p>Real world example, my Most Likely (M) is 12 months for a completed manuscript. My Optimistic (O) is 9 months. My Pessimistic (P) is 24 months. Add all three together and you get 45 months for my MOP. Divided by 3 is 15 months. 15 months is my Average Mop.</p><p>Hang onto this Average MOP, and hang onto its individual components. That way, you can monitor your progress and make better estimates next time. It’s not perfect, but it’s a hell of a lot better than taking a total shot in the dark.</p><h2>Not Meeting Deadlines? A Couple Techniques</h2><p>Maybe your self-imposed deadline isn’t being met, or maybe you have a deadline that is imposed by someone else. Either way, you can speed things up.</p><p><strong>Crashing:</strong></p><p>Throw resources at the problem. If you throw more time at the project, you might make up for being behind. Maybe you’re a slow typist. Can you pay someone to transcribe for you? Throw money at the problem. What resources do you have, and which can you burn to make more time?</p><p><strong>Fast-Tracking:</strong></p><p>This is where you take things that are normally done one after the other and do them at the same time. Fast-tracking always increases a project’s risk. For example, editing chapter 1 while writing chapter 2 is risky because you might waste time making changes to chapter 1 that end up needing to be changed back. But, hey, if you need to get something done, it's an option.</p><h2>Risk Management</h2><p>Is it likely, in the course of a year, that you’ll get derailed by a vacation? Yes. Illness? Yes.</p><p>Outline what could go wrong. Not EVERYTHING, not stuff like, “A pilot could be flying and smoking a cigarette, and then the cigarette goes in his eye and he crashes through the ceiling of my apartment and my computer blows up and then my manuscript is lost.” Think realistically. Is it likely, in the course of a year, that you’ll get derailed by a vacation? Yes. Illness? Yes. </p><p>Then, think about how you’re going to manage those risks. Think, before you’re in the heat of the moment, what you’re going to do when you lose momentum because you spent three days hugging a toilet. What’s the plan? What’s the plan when and if your computer breaks? Can you manage that risk now by putting away some cash for a replacement? Can you buy a bluetooth keyboard and type into your phone?</p><p>Give yourself 3-5 very likely risks, then come up with 3-5 good solutions.</p><h2>Close Project</h2><p>When your project is “Write a manuscript,” you will finish. And when you do, close out that project. Consider getting it published a different project or a different phase, but don’t let one bleed into the other.</p><p>Take this time to evaluate. How’d it go? What did I learn? What should I do differently next time? Can I cry slightly less? Do I need to shut my cat out of the room because cats love laptops almost to the point that I’ve started wondering whether humans evolved to create laptops so that cats could sit on them?</p><p>And take a little time to celebrate. You did it. You completed the project. Shut the lid on that laptop, open the lid on a beer. Closing the project gives you a definitive party point. Don't let it blow by. </p><div class="field field-type-asin field-field-amazon-item field-items"><div class="field-item odd amazon-item amazon-item-book amazon-item-details"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SYJ0KWZLL._SL160_.jpg" alt="Image of Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager Paperback" title="Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager Paperback" height="160" width="160" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><p></p><h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Unofficial-Manager-Paperback/dp/194163110X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIUVGEUAHUWQA3RSA&amp;amp;tag=litre-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=2025&amp;amp;creative=165953&amp;amp;creativeASIN=194163110X">Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager Paperback</a></h3><p><strong>Author:</strong> Kory Kogon, Suzette Blakemore, James Wood</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $10.88</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> FranklinCovey (2015)</p><p><strong>Binding:</strong> Paperback, 256 pages</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Unofficial-Manager-Paperback/dp/194163110X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIUVGEUAHUWQA3RSA&amp;tag=litre-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=194163110X" title="Click to buy Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager Paperback from Amazon.com"><img src="https://litreactor.com/sites/all/themes/litreactor/images/amazon-buy.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image" /></a></div><div class="field-item even amazon-item amazon-item-book amazon-item-details"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51W-ZL%2BQRlL._SL160_.jpg" alt="Image of Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity" title="Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity" height="160" width="104" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><p></p><h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563?SubscriptionId=AKIAIUVGEUAHUWQA3RSA&amp;amp;tag=litre-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=2025&amp;amp;creative=165953&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0143126563">Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</a></h3><p><strong>Author:</strong> David Allen</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $12.90</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Penguin Books (2015)</p><p><strong>Binding:</strong> Paperback, 352 pages</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563?SubscriptionId=AKIAIUVGEUAHUWQA3RSA&amp;tag=litre-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=0143126563" title="Click to buy Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity from Amazon.com"><img src="https://litreactor.com/sites/all/themes/litreactor/images/amazon-buy.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="image" /></a></div></div>]]>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 5 min<p>(<em>Author Tyler Hayes’s novel,</em> <a href="https://www.angryrobotbooks.com/shop/year/2019/the-imaginary-corpse/">The Imaginary Corpse</a> <em>was released by Angry Robot Books on September 10, 2019, and can be found at all major booksellers.</em>)</p><p>(CN: mention of 2016 U.S. Presidential election)</p><p>When I started writing, I wrote grimdark. I wrote awful people in awful worlds, and plots where lots of people died and no one left happy. My debut novel is about a plush triceratops with a surplus of empathy who feels pain if anyone says a dirty word. What happened?</p><p>What happened is, I realized I like giving a shit.</p><p>No insult meant to grimdark. I’ve read grimdark with a ton of heart, and I know grimdark writers who care very deeply. But when I started writing, I thought it was grimdark or nothing; that I had to be bleak and upsetting in order to be a serious writer.  I was also miserable. My politics were toxic, my jokes peppered with misogyny and racism. I had anger issues I could neither breathe deep enough nor rage loud enough to get out of me. I broke down crying on a near-weekly basis. My guiding light was my writing career: if I could sell a book, I thought, wading through all the garbage would be worth it.</p><p>It didn’t happen. I published a couple short stories, but no one was biting on my novels. I got more angry, more hopeless. But one of my friends was dating a writer, and she mentioned this writer would do a critique of a short story for forty bucks. Forty bucks seemed like a reasonable price for some direction re: my whole entire future. So I ponied up, and I emailed him my story.</p><p>Reader, he destroyed me. He had a lot of feelings about the story (all of them negative), but the advice that’s burned into my brain tissue is this: stop writing stories in the style of another author, and start writing Tyler Hayes stories.</p><p>It wasn’t an immediate epiphany, less a light-switch than the starting point of a Rube Goldberg machine, but it eventually brought me to a realization that quite literally saved my life.</p><p>I had been pretending to be grimdark. I wasn’t writing it for exploration or catharsis, I was writing it to tick a box. And I wasn’t just pretending to be a grimdark writer, I was pretending to be a grimdark <em>person.</em> I acted like I cared about nothing when I actually cared about everything. I wanted to be enthusiastic. Kind. Hopeful. When I heard the term “hopepunk” for the first time, I finally had a word for what I wrote–and what I was.</p><p>The darkness in my stories hasn’t stopped; honestly, I think I’ve gotten better at it. But I’ve learned that what I love isn’t the darkness, it’s the light shining in the middle of it. The idea that no matter how awful things get, the best thing we can do is to remember to give a shit. And when I focused on that, I saw results.</p><p>I sold a story, with a main character I actually felt some sympathy for. Then one about learning empathy in the wake of tragedy. Then one about leaving an abusive relationship. Tyler Hayes stories: stories about how the good things among the bad are worth fighting to hold onto. And as I wrote about holding onto the good things in life, I learned to do it for myself.</p><p>I stopped making ‘edgy’ jokes. I started using trigger warnings and content notices. I went into therapy for anxiety and what turned out to be PTSD, and I sought medication, and the anger in me finally started to go quiet. I tried to listen more, to take up less space, to meet people where they are. I learned to practice radical empathy, toward others and toward myself. I forged new friendships, improved old ones. I was the happiest I can remember being since middle school.</p><p>Then November 2016 happened.</p><p>As soon as the election results were foregone, I scream-cried into a pillow for hours, terrified by what I knew would come next. I was ready to throw in the towel, put myself under with junk food and booze and wait for the appointment with the coroner. But in a moment of clarity, I got on Twitter, and made a promise: I would continue to give a shit. I would try to help people, whether they needed to be cheered up or told it’s okay to be upset–and when a day came that I needed an assist, I would be vulnerable and ask for it. And I would try to write worlds where, ultimately, the right choice is to do the same. I had never felt more sure this was the right path to go down than when that was the novel that finally, finally sold.</p><p>We can’t smile a Nazi march out of existence. We can’t write a predator into a jail cell. But faced with people who want to paint compassion as weakness and cruelty as justice, giving a shit is an act of rebellion. Faced with people who want to tell us who counts as human, being who you are is an act of self-defense. And telling others it’s okay to do those things is arming the troops.</p><p>Take care of each other. Take care of yourselves. Be who you are inside, as much and as safely as you can. If that means being there for your friends, keep those DMs open. If that means writing grimdark catharsis, break out the chainswords. Just, please, give a shit. You might save someone–and even if you only save yourself, that’s more than enough.</p><p><em>With thanks to Alexandra Rowland for the term “hopepunk” and to an unknown Tumblr user for the title of this essay.</em></p><p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4184" src="https://uncannymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Imaginary-Corpse-675x1024.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="1024" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /></p><p><em><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4185" src="https://uncannymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tyler-Hayes-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />Tyler Hayes is a science fiction and fantasy writer from Northern California.

You learned everything about the narcissist, you know who the narcissist is, but the thing with narcissists is they have “lucky charms” that work for them and carry their dirty laundry while making sure no one sees that the king is naked. So, it is very hard to live in a world that seems to be created to breed and serve these cheaters and manipulators.</p><p>These chameleons have multiple faces that they proudly display to others and each face is more deceitful than the previous. They can talk and engage with any social group and be liked by everyone. However, there is a catch – they usually have one target they have in mind and that is a person who has qualities of compassion, integrity, and empathy. Why? Because the narcissist envies anyone who is better than them and in their mind, they become a threat that needs to be eliminated. The narcissist feels they must dim their light fast.</p><p>Sadly, the target will become enlightened to the true self of the narcissist, they will see behind their mask but they will not be able to do anything because they are so deep in the connection with them. This form of abuse happens in all kinds of relationships from romantic and family to work ones. It takes place in any situation where the narcissist is able to abuse and manipulate another human being.</p><p>So, how the narcissist is able to get away with all the manipulation and still be seen as a good person?</p><noscript>

</noscript><p>The narcissists are very skillful at managing the ways how other people see them. They can praise their ‘victims’ when they are with them in public, but demean them and criticize them behind closed doors. The narcissist has the ability to provoke others into reacting emotionally which will make them look unstable. That’s how the narcissist covertly abuses their victims – by making them look like they are the abusers and not the victims.</p><p>Whenever they get in contact with someone new, the narcissist is immediately labeling them as someone who may be useful to them and a threat or if not, they don’t bother with them. Those people who get labeled as a threat whether because of their education, talents, success, competence, or other qualities that are important to the narcissist, will first get praised and adored by the narcissist before getting utterly devalued and discarded.</p><p>The narcissist will build a mighty pedestal for their victim in order to stage their destruction. They will first idealize their victim, but they will later keep them off-balance by not letting them know where they stand in the narcissist’s life. That’s how the narcissist inflicts pain and doubt into their heart. Therefore, the chosen victim will get devalued and idealized at the same time together with the other victims of the narcissist until getting kicked off from the pedestal for calling the narcissist out of their shit.</p><p>In the narcissist’s labyrinth of manipulation, mind-games, and lies the only winner is the narcissist and the victims who are actually able to leave the narcissist and move on with their life.</p><p>Moreover, narcissists have something in them that makes people trust them. Whether it is their handsome appearance, their charm, their intellect, or something else, there is just something in them that is mesmerizing to others. This is called a “halo effect” in psychology which is a tendency for people to take one good trait (for instance: “They are so charming”) and then attribute it to the rest of their personality (They must be a smart and good person too!).</p><p>And because the narcissist spends their whole life designing a very alluring but false image about themselves, in front of other people they appear to be very caring, warm, and kind. They drive people in with their false trustworthiness and supposed but nonexistent integrity. They carefully choose their victims to be ones who have not yet seen their true self or are willing to disregard all the red flags.</p><p>If, however, the narcissist feels they are in trouble of being exposed, they will defend themselves claiming the victims are the problem because they want to cause problems without a reason.</p><p>And the reason why we are not equipped to deal with these manipulators is that when someone treats us badly and abuses us in some way, we tend to project our own sense of empathy and morality towards them and convince ourselves that deep inside they are a good person.</p><p>That’s why it is so important to validate our inner voices and speak up. If you are a survivor as well, then we should all raise our voices and spread awareness to confront these abusers. That’s how revolutions begin. We are all in this together and we can stop this madness.</p><div class="abh_box abh_box_down abh_box_business"><ul class="abh_tabs">

I have spent years studying what it means to be white in a society that proclaims race meaningless, yet is deeply divided by race. This is what I have learned: Any white person living in the United States will develop opinions about race simply by swimming in the water of our culture. But mainstream sources—schools, textbooks, media—don’t provide us with the multiple perspectives we need.</p><div class="gmp-instream-wrap"><p>Don’t like ads? <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/registration/">Become a supporter</a> and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free</p></div><p>Yes, we will develop strong emotionally laden opinions, but they will not be informed opinions. Our socialization renders us racially illiterate. When you add a lack of humility to that illiteracy (because we don’t know what we don’t know), you get the break-down we so often see when trying to engage white people in meaningful conversations about race.</p><div class="c14"><table border="0.5" cellpadding="0" style="width: 350px; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td>

</tr></tbody></table></div><p>Mainstream dictionary definitions reduce racism to individual racial prejudice and the intentional actions that result. The people that commit these intentional acts are deemed bad, and those that don’t are good. If we are against racism and unaware of committing racist acts, we can’t be racist; racism and being a good person have become mutually exclusive. But this definition does little to explain how racial hierarchies are consistently reproduced.</p><p>Social scientists understand racism as a multidimensional and highly adaptive <em>system—</em>a system that ensures an unequal distribution of resources between racial groups. Because whites built and dominate all significant institutions, (often at the expense of and on the uncompensated labor of other groups), their interests are embedded in the foundation of U.S. society.</p><p>While individual whites may be against racism, they still benefit from the distribution of resources controlled by their group. Yes, an individual person of color can sit at the tables of power, but the overwhelming majority of decision-makers will be white. Yes, white people can have problems and face barriers, but systematic racism won’t be one of them. This distinction—between individual prejudice and a system of unequal institutionalized racial power—is fundamental. One cannot understand how racism functions in the U.S. today if one ignores group power relations.</p><div class="c15"><table border="0.5" cellpadding="0" style="width: 350px; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>We have organized society to reproduce and reinforce our racial interests and perspectives. Further, we are centered in all matters deemed normal, universal, benign, neutral and good.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div><p>This systemic and institutional control allows those of us who are white in North America to live in a social environment that protects and insulates us from <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/white-people-freak-theyre-called-race-hesaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">race-based stress</a>. We have organized society to reproduce and reinforce our racial interests and perspectives. Further, we are centered in all matters deemed normal, universal, benign, neutral and good. Thus, we move through a wholly racialized world with an unracialized identity (e.g. white people can represent all of humanity, people of color can only represent their racial selves).</p><p>Challenges to this identity become highly stressful and even intolerable. The following are examples of the kinds of challenges that trigger racial stress for white people:</p><ul><li>Suggesting that a white person’s viewpoint comes from a racialized frame of reference (challenge to objectivity);</li>
<li>People of color talking directly about their own racial perspectives (challenge to white taboos on talking openly about race);</li>
<li>People of color choosing not to protect the racial feelings of white people in regards to race (challenge to white racial expectations and need/entitlement to racial comfort);</li>
<li>People of color not being willing to tell their stories or answer questions about their racial experiences (challenge to the expectation that <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/why-i-dont-want-to-talk-about-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people of color will serve us</a>);</li>
<li>A fellow white not providing agreement with one’s racial perspective (challenge to white solidarity);</li>
<li>Receiving feedback that one’s behavior had a racist impact (challenge to white racial innocence);</li>
<li>Suggesting that group membership is significant (challenge to individualism);</li>
<li>An acknowledgment that access is unequal between racial groups (challenge to meritocracy);</li>
<li>Being presented with a person of color in a position of leadership (challenge to white authority);</li>
<li>Being presented with information about other racial groups through, for example, movies in which people of color drive the action but are not in stereotypical roles, or multicultural education (challenge to white centrality).</li>
</ul><p>Not often encountering these challenges, we withdraw, defend, cry, argue, minimize, ignore, and in other ways push back to regain our racial position and equilibrium. I term that push back <em>white fragility.</em></p><p>This concept came out of my on-going experience leading discussions on race, racism, white privilege and white supremacy with primarily white audiences. It became clear over time that white people have extremely low thresholds for enduring any discomfort associated with challenges to our racial worldviews.</p><p>We can manage the first round of challenge by ending the discussion through platitudes—usually something that starts with “People just need to,” or “Race doesn’t really have any meaning to me,” or “Everybody’s racist.” Scratch any further on that surface, however, and we fall apart.</p><div class="c14"><table border="0.5" cellpadding="0" style="width: 350px; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td>

</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div><p>Socialized into a deeply internalized sense of superiority and entitlement that we are either not consciously aware of or can never admit to ourselves, we become highly fragile in conversations about race. We experience a challenge to our racial worldview as a challenge to our very identities as good, moral people. It also challenges our sense of rightful place in the hierarchy. Thus, we perceive any attempt to connect us to the system of racism as a very unsettling and unfair moral offense.</p><p>The following patterns make it difficult for white people to understand racism as a <em>system</em> and lead to the dynamics of white fragility. While they do not apply to every white person, they are well-documented overall:</p><p><strong><em>Segregation</em>:</strong> Most whites live, grow, play, learn, love, work and die primarily in social and geographic racial segregation. Yet, our society does not teach us to see this as a loss. Pause for a moment and consider the magnitude of this message: We lose nothing of value by having no cross-racial relationships. In fact, the whiter our schools and neighborhoods are, the more likely they are to be seen as “good.” The implicit message is that there is no inherent value in the presence or perspectives of people of Color. This is an example of the relentless messages of white superiority that circulate all around us, shaping our identities and worldviews.</p><p><strong><em>The Good/Bad Binary</em>:</strong> The most effective adaptation of racism over time is the idea that racism is conscious bias held by mean people. If we are not aware of having negative thoughts about people of color, don’t tell racist jokes, are nice people, and even have friends of color, then we cannot be racist. Thus, a person is either racist or not racist; if a person is racist, that person is bad; if a person is not racist, that person is good. Although racism does of course occur in individual acts, these acts are part of a larger system that we all participate in. The focus on individual incidences prevents the analysis that is necessary in order to challenge this larger system. The good/bad binary is the fundamental misunderstanding driving white defensiveness about being connected to racism. We simply do not understand how socialization and implicit bias work.</p><div class="gmp-instream-wrap"><p>Don’t like ads? <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/registration/">Become a supporter</a> and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free</p></div><p><strong><em>Individualism</em>:</strong> Whites are taught to see themselves as individuals, rather than as part of a racial group. Individualism enables us to deny that racism is structured into the fabric of society. This erases our history and hides the way in which wealth has accumulated over generations and benefits us, <em>as a group</em>, today.  It also allows us to distance ourselves from the history and actions of our group. Thus we get very irate when we are “accused” of racism, because as individuals, we are “different” from other white people and expect to be seen as such; we find intolerable any suggestion that our behavior or perspectives are typical of our group as a whole.</p><div class="c15"><table border="0.5" cellpadding="0" style="width: 350px; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>In fact, the whiter our schools and neighborhoods are, the more likely they are to be seen as “good.” The implicit message is that there is no inherent value in the presence or perspectives of people of Color.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong><em>Entitlement to racial comfort:</em></strong> In the dominant position, whites are almost always racially comfortable and thus have developed unchallenged expectations to remain so. We have not had to build tolerance for racial discomfort and thus when racial discomfort arises, whites typically respond as if something is “wrong,” and blame the person or event that triggered the discomfort (usually a person of color). This blame results in a socially-sanctioned array of responses towards the perceived source of the discomfort, including: penalization; retaliation; isolation and refusal to continue engagement. Since racism is necessarily uncomfortable in that it is oppressive, white insistence on racial comfort guarantees racism will not be faced except in the most superficial of ways.</p><p><strong><em>Racial Arrogance:</em></strong> Most whites have a very limited understanding of racism because we have not been trained to think in complex ways about it and because it benefits white dominance not to do so. Yet, we have no compunction about debating the knowledge of people who have thought complexly about race. Whites generally feel free to dismiss these informed perspectives rather than have the humility to acknowledge that they are unfamiliar, reflect on them further, or seek more information.</p><p><strong><em>Racial Belonging:</em></strong> White people enjoy a deeply internalized, largely unconscious sense of racial belonging in U.S. society. In virtually any situation or image deemed valuable in dominant society, whites belong. The interruption of racial belonging is rare and thus destabilizing and frightening to whites and usually avoided.</p><p><strong><em>Psychic freedom:</em></strong> Because race is constructed as residing in people of color, whites don’t bear the social burden of race. We move easily through our society without a sense of ourselves as racialized. Race is for people of color to think about—it is what happens to “them”—they can bring it up if it is an issue for them (although if they do, we can dismiss it as a personal problem, the race card, or the reason for their problems). This allows whites much more psychological energy to devote to other issues and prevents us from developing the stamina to sustain attention on an issue as charged and uncomfortable as race.</p><div class="c14"><table border="0.5" cellpadding="0" style="width: 350px; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td>

</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong><em>Constant messages that we are more valuable:</em></strong> Living in a white dominant context, we receive constant messages that we are better and more important than people of color. For example: our centrality in history textbooks, historical representations and perspectives; our centrality in media and advertising; our teachers, role-models, heroes and heroines; everyday discourse on “good” neighborhoods and schools and who is in them; popular TV shows centered around friendship circles that are all white; religious iconography that depicts God, Adam and Eve, and other key figures as white. While one may explicitly reject the notion that one is inherently better than another, one cannot avoid internalizing the message of white superiority, as it is ubiquitous in mainstream culture.</p><p>These privileges and the white fragility that results prevent us from listening to or comprehending the perspectives of people of color and bridging cross-racial divides. The antidote to white fragility is on-going and life-long, and includes sustained engagement, humility, and education. We can begin by:</p><ul><li>Being willing to tolerate the discomfort associated with an honest appraisal and discussion of our internalized superiority and racial privilege.</li>
<li>Challenging our own racial reality by acknowledging ourselves as racial beings with a particular and limited perspective on race.</li>
<li>Attempting to understand the racial realities of people of color through authentic interaction rather than through the media or unequal relationships.</li>
<li>Taking action to address our own racism, the racism of other whites, and the racism embedded in our institutions—e.g., get educated and act.</li>

</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div><p>“Getting it” when it comes to race and racism challenges our very identities as good white people. It’s an ongoing and often painful process of seeking to uncover our socialization at its very roots. It asks us to rebuild this identity in new and often uncomfortable ways. But I can testify that it is also the most exciting, powerful, intellectually stimulating and emotionally fulfilling journey I have ever undertaken. It has impacted every aspect of my life—personal and professional.</p><p>I have a much deeper and more complex understanding of how society works. I can challenge much more racism in my daily life, and I have developed cherished and fulfilling cross-racial friendships I did not have before.</p><p>I do not expect racism to end in my lifetime, and I know that I continue to have problematic racist patterns and perspectives. Yet, I am also confident that I do less harm to people of color than I used to. This is not a minor point of growth, for it impacts my lived experience and that of the people of color who interact with me. If you are white I urge you to take the first step—let go of your racial certitude and reach for humility.</p><p class="c11">♦◊♦</p><h2> .</h2><h2 class="c10">Join our #StopRacism Weekly Calls on Tuesdays at 8 pm EST / 5 pm PST</h2><p>.<a class="c12" href="https://goodmenproject.leadpages.co/leadbox/14396ae73f72a2%3A1344ef5baf46dc/5681904711892992/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSVP for #StopRacism Calls</a></p><p>Our new social interest groups include weekly phone calls and a chance to help change the world. Calls are for Members Only.

Although the Dominion forces arrived too late to prevent the minefield from being successfully deployed and activated, thus preventing reinforcements from arriving in the Alpha Quadrant, the Dominion continued its assault on Deep Space 9, eventually forcing all Federation forces aboard to evacuate in late <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2373" title="2373">2373</a>, and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Deep_Space_9" title="Second Battle of Deep Space 9">took over the station</a> immediately after its abandonment by the Federation.</p>
<p>Countering the attack on Deep Space 9, the Federation-Klingon alliance dispatched a successful task force to attack the Dominion shipyards at <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Torros_III" title="Torros III">Torros III</a>, setting back Dominion ship production for months.

<p>During the first few months of <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2374" title="2374">2374</a>, the Dominion was leading an extremely successful campaign against the allies, forcing them to retreat on nearly every front.

Admiral <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Coburn" title="Coburn">Coburn</a> objected to the plan, fearing that too many ships would be diverted away from Earth, allowing the Dominion to attack it, but Sisko was able to convince him otherwise. With only three days before the minefield could be deactivated, however, the Federation was forced to launch what ships they had been able to gather to attack Deep Space 9 and start <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Operation_Return" title="Operation Return">Operation Return</a>. A Federation fleet of over six hundred vessels, eventually aided by Klingon forces, enabled the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Defiant_(2370)" title="USS Defiant (2370)">USS <em>Defiant</em></a> to break through the Dominion's lines, consisting of 1,254 ships, and reach Deep Space 9, where Captain Sisko was able to convince the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Prophet" title="Prophet">Prophets</a> to entirely wipe out the Dominion reinforcements while they were traveling through the wormhole. With no reinforcements on their way, and the fleet battle in favor of the Federation-Klingon forces, the Dominion was forced to withdraw from the station.

<figcaption>A schematic showing the Dominion's capture of Betazed, which represented a major blow to Federation morale</figcaption></figure><p>Despite their successful retaking of Deep Space 9, the Dominion was able to occupy <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Betazed" title="Betazed">Betazed</a> during the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Betazed" title="Battle of Betazed">Battle of Betazed</a> in late <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2374" title="2374">2374</a>, although the Federation's <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tenth_Fleet" title="Tenth Fleet">Tenth Fleet</a> had been assigned to defend the planet but was caught out of position on a training exercise. With the capture of this system, the Dominion was in a position to invade Vulcan, Andor, Tellar, and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>. Furthermore, the Federation was suffering a manpower shortage after sustaining massive casualties up to this point, and many of their shipyards were still being rebuilt. The Dominion's shipyards, on the other hand, were producing at 100% capacity and legions of <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Jem%27Hadar" title="Jem'Hadar">Jem'Hadar</a> were being bred at an incredible rate. In order to turn the tide by bringing the Romulan Star Empire into the war, Captain Sisko undertook a successful ploy and the Romulans joined the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Federation_Alliance" title="Federation Alliance">Federation Alliance</a>.

First and foremost, however, the Council's ethic decisions became more questionable, even compromising the principles upon which the Federation had been founded.

A <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_Integrity_Commission" title="Temporal Integrity Commission">Temporal Integrity Commission</a> was soon formed as well as <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_Accord" title="Temporal Accord">Temporal Accords</a>, dedicated to prevent any <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_incursion" title="Temporal incursion">temporal incursions</a>, intentional or unintentional, from occurring or the timeline from collapsing and ensuring that the exploration of time could be performed without interferences. However, from various sides, there rose massive opposition to these restrictions to time travel and the Federation was soon drawn into a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_Cold_War" title="Temporal Cold War">Temporal Cold War</a> that spread across history, involving numerous factions, some of whom even tried to alter history in order to prevent the Federation from forming.

There, temporal contamination by the advanced technology of Braxton's ship turned out to be the very reason for the temporal explosion in the first place. Fortunately, <em>Voyager</em>'s crew was able to prevent this contamination, so an alternate version of Braxton who never experienced these events was able to return <em>Voyager</em> to the Delta Quadrant of the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/24th_century" title="24th century">24th century</a>, ending this temporal incursion.

<p>In order to intentionally thwart the foundation of the Federation, the historical events surrounding Captain <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Archer" title="Jonathan Archer">Jonathan Archer</a> of the <em>Enterprise</em> posed a tempting target. A <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_agent" title="Temporal agent">temporal agent</a> from the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/31st_century" title="31st century">31st century</a> posing as <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Crewman" title="Crewman">crewman</a> <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Daniels_(Crewman)" title="Daniels (Crewman)">Daniels</a> on the <em>Enterprise</em> assisted Captain Archer and his crew numerous times in order to take their roles in history and maintain the timeline. In <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2152" title="2152">2152</a>, however, Daniels inadvertently averted the Federation from ever coming into being by taking Archer some nine hundred years into the future. Thanks to his crew and a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Silik" title="Silik">Suliban</a>'s misunderstanding, he returned to his own time period, resetting the timeline. (<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">ENT</a>: "<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Bow_(episode)" title="Broken Bow (episode)">Broken Bow</a>", "<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Cold_Front_(episode)" title="Cold Front (episode)">Cold Front</a>", "<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Shockwave_(episode)" title="Shockwave (episode)">Shockwave</a>")</p>
<p>Another instance that nearly prevented the Federation from being founded was when a weapon created by the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Xindi" title="Xindi">Xindi</a> attacked Earth, killing seven million people. A race of transdimensional aliens, called <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Sphere-Builder" title="Sphere-Builder">Sphere-Builders</a>, were defeated by the Federation in the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/26th_century" title="26th century">26th century</a> so they deceived the Xindi into thinking Earth would attack them in the future, convincing them that they should preemptively attack Earth and annihilate Humanity, thereby eradicating the future Federation. With more help from Daniels, Archer and his crew were ultimately able to destroy the weapon as well as the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Delphic_Expanse_sphere" title="Delphic Expanse sphere">sphere network</a>, ending the Sphere-Builders influence in normal space.

</figure><p><em>Recently, photographer Tod Seelie and writer Anna Merlan <a href="https://jalopnik.com/vanlife-can-be-cheaper-weirder-and-more-accessible-th-1836822787" rel="nofollow">documented a blazing hot trip through the Southwest</a> in Seelie’s heroic 19-year-old minivan Goldie. Now you can do the same: Below are Seelie’s helpful, hard-won tips to help make vanlife on a budget work for you.<br /></em></p>
<h3>Tips:</h3>
<ul><li>Always carry a basic set of tools and a good flashlight and headlamp for minor road repairs. Try to learn some basic maintenance (changing a flat or a headlight bulb) before you hit the road.</li>
<li>Having a 12 volt inverter will increase the number of things you can run on the car battery, like a laptop.</li>
<li>Always have spare 12volt accessory plug fuses before you need them. If you’re using an inverter, there’s a good chance you’ll need them eventually.</li>
<li>There are a wide variety of LED solar lanterns available now. Keep one on your dash and you’ll never need to run the interior lights at night.</li>
<li>Keep a paper road atlas just in case the GPS fails.</li>
<li>One of the goals of car camping is to find nice campsites, official or otherwise, and when you do you’re going to want a folding table and chairs to cook and eat on. A nice campsite is a lot more pleasant when you’re actually able to sit outside and enjoy it.</li>
<li>A major drawback to camping in a minivan is the lack of headroom. I recommend getting one of those little three-legged folding stools. They tend to be just the right height to be able to sit up in the van and make sandwiches on the cooler and then can fold up and tuck under your mattress to disappear when not in use.</li>
<li>If you’re camping in your car, tinted back windows are your friend.</li>
<li>I found mesh mosquito “socks” that slip over the top of the front doors to keep insects out while your windows are down at night to let cooler night air in.</li>
<li>This trick was a lifesaver on a summer trip through the southwest: a DC fan with a compatible 12 volt power plug that I picked up a 12v battery for (usually used for security systems) and a 12v socket with alligator clamps to connect to the batteries contacts. This way you can run the fan with the car off while you sleep and not drain the starter battery, and then charge the battery with the inverter while you’re driving the next day. (You’ll need the additional charger.)</li>
<li>If you’re going to be on the road for an extended amount of time and want to try and stay in shape, consider getting a Planet Fitness membership. Not just for the ability to exercise after too many days in the driver’s seat, but also for the showers. Planet Fitness has some of the best coverage of locations across the U.S.</li>
<li>Keep a small padlock in the car for lockers in gyms and pools.</li>
<li>One extra recommendation is a solar/crank emergency radio with weather band. It can be nice to eat dinner with music or explore the local flavor via talk radio even when you’re out of cell range. It’s also useful to check on the local weather when it starts to look ominous so you aren’t the only person sitting clueless while your van is rocking from the wind in an empty Walmart parking lot during a nearby tornado (true story).</li>
</ul>

<figcaption class="no-caption">Photo: <a href="http://todseelie.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tod Seelie</a></figcaption></div>
</figure><h3>Food:</h3>
<ul><li>For the easiest cup of coffee first thing in the morning, go for Starbucks instant coffee and those little liquid creamer buckets, if you’re into that sort of thing. Alternately, get liquid coffee concentrate (Trader Joe’s is very good) if you’ve got the cooler space.</li>
<li>Pack and use reusable travel mugs, utensils, straws, etc. Some truck stops give you a discount if you bring your own mug. Besides, this planet is being buried under plastic waste, so you might as well start to adapt to the inevitable non-disposable future.</li>
<li>Get a good decent-sized cooler with a drain spout, then measure the bottom width and length to try to find some sort of elevated “rack” to keep your food out of the inevitable melted ice pool. Nothing ruins your groceries like sitting in water all day. I’ve had good luck with turning two silverware trays upside down, but keep in mind you don’t want anything that will rust. There is also a technique of packing dry ice into the bottom of the cooler and then covering it with regular ice that lasts a long time.</li>
<li>When you’re just sitting in a car all day you’re not burning many calories so it’s smart to eat healthier than normal so as to not feel crappy. The healthiest and most easily located meal across America? Bagged salads. If you’re camping in a Walmart parking lot anyway, then you’ve already found them.</li>
<li>If for some reason you can’t find bagged salads and the only option around is a gas station or truck stop, I recommend what I used to call “band tour breakfast:” a V8 and a banana.</li>
<li>I don’t recommend fast food for many reasons, but I do make an exception for the most plentiful chain in the U.S.: Subway. The trick is to only get the veggie sub or the egg sandwich for some protein (still get it piled with vegetables), it’s another of the hard-to-find fresh vegetable solutions when you don’t want to cook or can’t find a grocery store. You can’t be doing burger-n-fries every night when you have barely moved from the driver’s seat all day.</li>
<li>One road snack I make is a lettuce taco: large romaine lettuce leaves as the shell, plus hummus, plus cheese, plus diced tomatoes.</li>
<li>For food to snack on when I’m driving I opt for mini cucumbers (kind of like a candy bar) and baby carrots.</li>
<li>Another thing you don’t want to do when not moving much is drink a lot of sugary drinks. My go-to option is flavored seltzer, or sometimes I’ll make tea when I’ve maxed out my coffee intake for the day.</li>
<li>I use a denatured alcohol stove to cook meals. It’s simple, the fuel is easy to find, and the flame isn’t bright, which good for stealth cooking. It also burns hot and clean and it’s very affordable.</li>
<li>Couscous is incredibly fast and easy to cook over a camp stove! I usually do that with a packet of ready-made Indian food and a healthy dose of arugula for dinner.</li>
<li>A quick way to upgrade otherwise boring instant oatmeal for breakfast is with a handful of cranberry and nuts trail mix thrown in. Top with fresh fruit.</li>
<li>This one was a game-changer for me. I had been using a standard sponge and dish soap to clean my dishes every night, which requires a fair bit of water and creates wastewater, both of which are not ideal. A friend recommended using Trader Joe’s all-purpose cleaner instead. It’s made cleanup immensely easier.</li>

</figure><h3>Sleeping:</h3>
<ul><li>IKEA’s cheapest mattress is a piece of foam with a cover that happens to be the exact right width for a minivan. It’s also pliable enough to get folded over the back of the bed frame with the back hatch closed so as to easily shorten it when not being used fully extended.</li>
<li>Always have good earplugs so you can comfortably sleep when the parking spot has you resting a bit too close to a row of rumbling trucks. (I prefer the Macks molded silicone kind; they don’t expand so your ears won’t get sore from the pressure.)</li>
<li>Those windshield reflector panels (often depicting a tropical beach scene) are not only useful for keeping the car cooler, but they also double as a privacy shield at night.</li>
<li>There are a lot of different ways to block out your back windows when your sleeping (I’ve just stuffed extra pillows in them on occasion, for lack of better options), but if you want to go pro you can custom cut some panels of garage door insulation to pop in. They also will help keep the car cooler when the sun comes up.</li>
<li>Whenever you can, you should try to park in what will be shaded when the sun rises when you stop for the night. There are free sun locator apps, mainly targeted at photographers, that you can use to predict the sunrise through your camera’s live view.</li>
<li>I’ve slept in my van in below-freezing temperatures by using a mix of different bedding layers: sleeping bag, wool blankets, down comforter. Pretty much any vehicle is going to become the same temperature inside as out over the course of a night, so plan accordingly.</li>
<li>Another trick for cold weather sleeping is to fully cover your head and face with just a small open space around your nose and mouth. It greatly decreases the amount of heat lost and helps your pile of blankets make the cut when it’s snowing outside.</li>
</ul><figure class="js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed"><div class="js_img-wrapper img-wrapper lazy-image c6">
<figcaption class="no-caption">Photo: <a href="http://todseelie.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tod Seelie</a></figcaption></div>
</figure><h3>Budget:</h3>
<ul><li>To find cheap fuel, try the app <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/App" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gas Buddy</a> to search in your area or down the road for the best prices. If you’re going to be crossing a state line, check the prices on either side to see if one state’s taxes cause a notable difference in prices. Also keep in mind the app is crowd-sourced, so in some areas it may not have any reported prices.</li>
<li>There are a decent number of free legal places to park overnight: Walmart, Cracker Barrel, Sam’s Club and Dicks Sporting Goods parking lots, rest stops (my preference) and BLM land (primarily in the West). They each have their advantages: Walmarts are usually easy to find and near major highways, while BLM land is often out of your way, sometimes considerably, but is usually quiet, serene and beautiful. If you know what your priorities are for the night, you can usually plan ahead pretty well.</li>
</ul>

</figure><p>Other resources that can come in handy for low-budget traveling are the plethora of road trip and vanlife apps, like Roadtrippers, AllStays and BLM land maps. Also, this cannot be overstated: don’t be a bad traveler. In essence, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/leave-no-trace-seven-principles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leave No Trace</a> and <a href="https://generationdirtbag.com/7-vanlife-rules-to-live-by/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don’t Be A Dick</a>.</p>
<p>When you are passing through areas, camping in off-beat places, or just parking overnight at a rest stop, you are a representative of everyone else doing the same. In the same vein as “this is why we can’t have nice things” it can be ruined in the general public opinion by people who are disrespectful or damaging to the communities they are in and the resources they rely on. So when you are there on a fun vanlife trip with your friends, it’s always important to remember that some people living in vehicles aren’t there by choice, and your behavior can impact those with no other options.</p>
<p>To sum it up: not everything is for just you.</p>
<p>If we all adopt this approach not only will everyone have a better time, but we might also not kill everything we love with <a href="https://jezebel.com/instagram-influencers-are-wrecking-public-lands-meet-t-1833781844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrespectful overtourism</a>.</p>

<p>Traveling the country is an exciting, and historically American, activity. Depending on your necessary comfort level it can be very affordable and accessible, opening up the diverse expanse of this country to explore without needing a small fortune in doodads and a luxury vehicle to house them in.</p>
<p>Instead, invest in your own resourcefulness and creative problem-solving and you’ll find it’s a more interesting and satisfying trip in the end.</p>]]>

<p>The Austrian doctor after whom Asperger syndrome is named was an active participant in the Nazi regime, assisting in the Third Reich’s so called euthanasia programme and supporting the concept of racial hygiene by deeming certain children unworthy to live, <a href="https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-018-0208-6" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">according to a study by a medical historian</a>.</p>
<p>Herwig Czech, from Vienna’s Medical University, has made the claim in an academic paper published in the open access journal Molecular Autism, following eight years of research into the paediatrician Hans Asperger.</p>
<p>Asperger is hailed as a pioneer in the field of child psychiatry and paediatrics, particularly for his groundbreaking contribution to the understanding of Asperger syndrome and the autism spectrum.</p>
<p>But by unearthing previously untouched documents from state archives, including Asperger’s personnel files and patient case records, Czech has revealed a scientist who allied himself so closely with the Nazi ideology that he frequently referred children to the Am Spiegelgrund clinic, which was set up as a collecting point for children who failed to conform to the regime’s criteria of “worthy to live”. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/29/internationaleducationnews.humanities" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Nearly 800 children died at the clinic between 1940 and 1945</a>, many of whom were murdered under the notorious child “euthanasia” scheme.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the editors of Molecular Autism – Simon Baron-Cohen, Ami Klin, Steve Silberman and Joseph Buxbaum – said they welcomed the fact that Czech’s “meticulous research” had finally thrown light on decades of scepticism about Asperger’s claims that he had taken a caring approach to his patients.</p>
<p>“The degree of Asperger’s involvement in the targeting of Vienna’s most vulnerable children has remained an open and vexing question in autism research for a long time,” they wrote in a joint statement.</p>
<p>At the time the term Asperger syndrome was first coined in London in 1981, by Dr Lorna Wing, they added, “She and we as scientists and clinicians, as well as the broader autism community, were unaware of Hans Asperger’s close alliance with, and support of, the Nazi programme of compulsory sterilisation and euthanasia.”</p>

</figure><p>Among Czech’s findings is a photo of the distraught face of Herta Schreiber, who suffered from encephalitis and died of pneumonia three months after her admittance to Spiegelgrund, on Asperger’s orders, a day after her third birthday. </p>
<p>Asperger ordered her transfer because “she must be an unbearable burden to her mother” and she was deemed incurable. A specimen of Herta’s brain, found in a preparation jar in the basement of the clinic in the late 1990s, was buried in 2002, Czech said.</p>

<b>Herta Schreiber </b>
</div>
<p>Two year-old Herta Schreiber was one of the children Hans Asperger sent to the Spiegelgrund clinic, the collecting point for children not considered under Nazi criteria “hereditarily worthy” or “racially pure”, where almost 800 children died between 1940 and 1945, many murdered by poisoning and other means.</p>
<p>Asperger examined Herta on 27 June 1941. She was the youngest of nine children, and since falling ill with encephalitis a few months earlier had displayed signs of mental disturbance and impaired physical development.</p>
<p>Asperger wrote of Herta: “Severe personality disorder (post-encephalitic?): most severe motoric retardation; erethic idiocy; seizures. At home the child must be an unbearable burden to the mother, who has to care for five healthy children. Permanent placement at Spiegelgrund seems absolutely necessary.” </p>
<p>Herta was admitted to Spiegelgrund on 1 July 1941. The following month the head of Spiegelgrund, Erwin Jekelius, recommended she be considered for euthanasia. She died of pneumonia the day after her third birthday on 2 September 1941. Pneumonia was routinely induced in Spiegelgrund patients through the administration of barbiturates over a prolonged period. </p>
<p>A note in her file indicates her mother knew and accepted that her child would be killed. Her husband, at war, should not be informed, she told the doctors, as he would be too upset.<br /></p>
</div>
</div>
</details></figure><p>There was no evidence that Asperger deliberately targeted for euthanasia the patients with distinct psychological characteristics he had called “autistic psychopaths”, under the diagnosis for which he became famous, said Czech. But his diagnoses proved burdensome for many of his patients, even years after the collapse of the Nazi regime. Asperger continued working as a doctor for more than three decades. </p>
<p>Neither, said Czech, was there evidence of the benevolent attitude towards his patients that Asperger and others later boasted of. Czech also found a distinct lack of evidence of Asperger’s self-coined “pedagogic optimism”, according to which some could be treated or cured.</p>
<p>Asperger did take considerable pride in his “Heilpädagogik” – therapeutic pedagogy – which promoted the popular idea among his colleagues and Nazi leaders at a time of labour shortages that in certain cases people with autism made excellent soldiers and reliable workers. But Asperger also wrote about the need to “carry out restrictive measures” against patients deemed to be incurable and with hereditary conditions “out of a sense of great responsibility” towards the German race. </p>
<p>“In short, he was responsible for depriving of their liberty many children whom he deemed incapable of existing outside institutions,” Czech said.</p>
<p>Asperger rose to the highest position in the expanding field of therapeutic pedagogy, adapting it to suit Nazi ideology, and was promoted over the heads of Jewish colleagues who were forced out of the profession.</p>
<p>In his 43-page paper, Czech is deeply critical of authors in the English-speaking world, who he accused, over decades, of perpetuating a “predominantly apologetic narrative” of Asperger, “based on the limited range of sources available to them”. He also criticised Uta Frith, considered one of the UK’s leading autism experts, saying she had barely mentioned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nazism" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">Nazism</a> in her 1991 book Asperger and His Syndrome, which he believed had been instrumental in establishing the common view that Asperger had “defended his patients against the Nazi regime at great personal risk”, when the opposite had been the case, Czech said. Frith declined to comment for this article.</p>

</a>

</figure><p>Czech also lists examples of how Asperger often deemed sexually abused children to be responsible for the abuse and cites how antisemitic stereotypes crept into Asperger’s diagnostic reports. </p>
<p>“Asperger refused to acknowledge the reality of anti-Jewish persecution by the Nazi regime; this indifference is visible both during and after the war,” said Czech.</p>
<p>The historian admitted that his findings might well be painful for autistic people and their families to digest, but said he was obliged to reveal them. </p>
<p>“It would have been wrong for me to have withheld this information, however difficult it might be to hear,” he said. “At the same time, there is no evidence to show his contributions to autism research were tainted by his problematic role during National Socialism. So purging the term Asperger from the medical lexicon would not be helpful. Rather, this should be an opportunity to look at the past and learn lessons from it.”</p>
<p>Carol Povey, director at the National Autistic Society in the UK’s Centre for Autism, said: “We expect these findings to spark a big conversation among autistic people and their family members, particularly those who identify with the term ‘Asperger’. Obviously no one with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome should feel in any way tainted by this very troubling history.” </p>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 6 min<p>She seems a bit heavier than what you normally prefer, he isn’t as ambitious as you’d like, he’s kind of messy, she’s too bossy…</p><p>Basically, the other person just isn’t what you imagined for yourself. People become disposable commodities who either fit our checklist of what we want or they are discarded for being less than perfect.</p><p>But what happens when someone surprises you? They <a href="https://www.elephantjournal.com/2018/11/love-is-not-a-checklist/">don’t fit the checklist</a>, but you just can’t keep yourself from loving them anyway. When do you throw away your checklist, and when do you pay attention to the imperfections? How do you know if your preferences are requirements or desires, and does the difference matter?</p><p>I think the difference matters.</p><p>Yes, we all want what we not only require but what we desire…but sometimes our desires can outstrip our “requires” by a long shot, and that’s when we run the danger of asking more from one human being than is humanly possible.</p><p>If you keep finding yourself running the same <a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/relationship-patterns/">relationship patterns</a> of finding someone, dating for a certain length of time, and then dumping them or not being able to find someone to fit your standards, perhaps take a look at your require versus desire list and see what’s going on.</p><h3>Some examples of requirements to hold onto and not compromise:</h3><p class="c2"><strong>Respect.</strong> This person respects me and the people around them.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Character/integrity.</strong> This person is the same person from situation to situation, whether alone or in front of others.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Trust.</strong> I can <a href="https://www.elephantjournal.com/2019/08/brene-browns-definition-of-trust-kelsey-michal/">trust</a> this person.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Faith.</strong> We match on what we think is important as far as faith and how we want to share that part of ourselves with another.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Finances.</strong> Our priorities as far as spending, saving, and investing match, or we are at least able to find a common ground from which to work.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Family.</strong> We want the same things as far as children, family time, and commitment.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Fidelity</strong>. We have the same idea of what a healthy relationship looks like as far as sexual exclusivity or openness, marriage or not, and so on.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Partner.</strong> This person has what it takes to be a real partner for life and won’t revert to selfishness or finger-pointing when the going gets tough.</p><h3>Some yellow-light issues (things worth working on before ejecting from the relationship):</h3><p class="c2"><strong>Sexual incompatibility.</strong> I’ve heard stories of couples who manage to work it out and deepen their relationship at the same time. And I’ve heard of couples destroyed by it. It’s worth working on and investing some time in seeing if you can resolve the issues—unless it’s abuse-related (in which case, see below).</p><p class="c2"><strong>Your families are incompatible.</strong> This one is really tough, but many couples decide to set appropriate boundaries with their parents/siblings/family members rather than just walk away from love. You both need to make sure you are united in how you want to handle the issue to avoid resentment, blaming, or one family taking precedence over the other.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Addictions.</strong> Make sure the <a href="https://www.elephantjournal.com/2019/08/the-true-face-of-a-relationship-healing-from-alcoholism-matt-salis/">person with addiction issues</a> is in an active recovery pattern, complete with accountability, recognition of the problem, and a plan of action for staying clean. If you need more info about this, contact your nearest 12 Step group or a professional counselor. It’s not something to ignore, but it’s also something that can be worked with.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Health issues.</strong> Be clear on how this health issue affects day-to-day life and possible financial or activity-related restrictions. If you are okay with the sacrifices, this is also an issue that can be dealt with through honesty and compassion.</p><h3>Red-light issues (AKA get out <em>now</em>. Do not pass GO or collect $200. The plane is going down, so bail out now! You are on the Titanic…you get the idea.):</h3><p class="c2"><strong>Unresolved addiction issues.</strong> No person is magical enough to entice an addict away from their drug of choice, so don’t try. They need to have decided for themselves that they want to be better, and most 12 Step programs recommend at least a year of no dating after the initial sobriety period. Also note: “<a href="https://sobercompanionnyc.com/addiction-relapse-similar-chronic-diseases/">Relapse rates for addictive diseases range from 50 percent for resumption of heavy use to 90 percent for a brief lapse.</a>”</p><p class="c2"><strong>Abuse.</strong> I’m sorry, but there is simply no excuse for <a href="https://www.elephantjournal.com/2019/01/how-abusive-relationships-capture-us/">abuse</a>. Even if they <em>swear</em> it will never happen again. If you suspect that you may be in an abusive situation, get help. Talk to a trusted friend or family member to help you make the decision to get out and stick with it. Find a professional to talk to. Find a program for people in your situation. Oftentimes, people get into an abusive situation due to low self-esteem and stay in out of shame and fear. Just know that there is help from other people who have been in your shoes and found hope at the end of the tunnel.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Your value systems don’t line up.</strong> He wants exclusivity in a life partner, she wants an open relationship. She firmly believes in raising the children in her church, and he firmly believes children should be exposed to everything and allowed to make their own decisions. She thinks its okay to cut corners with things like paying taxes and bills, and he believes in being above reproach. Ninety-five percent of the time, it’s just not going to work. You’ll be able to see the fault lines in the things you argue about or avoid talking about completely. Do you end up screaming at each other about politics or disrespecting the other person for the way they handle their family? You just might have an unresolvable issue.</p><h3>Examples of desires that should never take precedence over your requires:</h3><p class="c2"><strong>Anything having to do with physical appearance.</strong> I know you don’t want to think about it, but looks really are the first thing to go, and when you have a screaming kid in your hands, you aren’t going to say to yourself, “I can’t wait till my hot spouse comes over here to help me out!” You’re going to think something more along the lines of, “He is such a great guy to be taking care of all the bills and making dinner while I try to get junior back to sleep.”</p><p class="c2"><strong>Wealth.</strong> Just in case you missed what’s been going on with our economy, that trust fund girl you hung onto for the money may not be so rich anymore, that finance guy you latched onto for his yearly bonus, well, he isn’t getting that bonus anymore. Wealth is here today and gone tomorrow. Look instead for attitudes around money to give you a better indicator of your date’s character around money and possessions.</p><p class="c2"><strong>Charm.</strong> Another “here today and gone tomorrow” trait. Charm can be deceptive, even while incredibly fun. A charmer is better left in the “flirt with only” category. Humor, intelligence, personality. These are all important and desires worth holding onto. But if he has all of these but no respect or isn’t trustworthy, you are going to regret the way you lined up your priorities. Just make sure to put the right things first.</p><p>If you aren’t sure whether your issue is a real issue or not, your community can turn out to be a lifeline for you—especially if you’ve cultivated relationships with happily married couples or centered/balanced friends who want the best for you. Avoid making your decision in a vacuum by seeking counsel from those you can trust.</p><p>~</p>]]>

Doing so may result in a closer look by the U.S. Department of Homeland <a href="http://www.forbes.com/security/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/security/">Security</a>.</p><p>In a story appearing earlier today on the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2150281/REVEALED-Hundreds-words-avoid-using-online-dont-want-government-spying-you.html#ixzz1w1SkH6gY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2150281/REVEALED-Hundreds-words-avoid-using-online-dont-want-government-spying-you.html#ixzz1w1SkH6gY">U.K's Daily Mail website</a>, it was reported that the DHS has been forced to release a list of keywords and phrases it uses to monitor various social networking sites. The list provides a glimpse into what DHS describes as "signs of terrorist or other threats against the U.S."</p><p>The list was posted by the <a href="http://epic.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> who filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act, before suing to obtain the release of the documents.

The Daily Mail's article noted the Electronic Privacy Information Center wrote a letter to the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counter-terrorism and Intelligence, describing it's choice of words as 'broad, vague and ambiguous'.</p><p>What wasn't disclosed is how the agency actually gains access to the various search engines and social networks to monitor the specified keywords. My guess is the DHS has a "special arrangement" with companies like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/google/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:/companies/google/" rel="nofollow noopener">Google</a> , <a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/facebook/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:/companies/facebook/" rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/microsoft/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:/companies/microsoft/" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft</a> , Yahoo and Twitter to gain secure direct API access. This type of access would allow it to use distributed cloud technologies to monitor the daily flow of social media and search activity in something close to real time.</p><p>I would love to learn more about the technologies used to accomplish this type of social / web monitoring.

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 10 min<p><em>This list is taken from a slideshow used for a “Know Your Rights” training video from the Civil Liberties Defense Center, and is designed for people using screen readers. <a href="https://cldc.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/KYR-Adult-Slideshow.pdf">If you’d prefer to view the slideshow, you can do that here.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLErjo_8H2M">You can also watch the video here.</a></em></p><h3><strong>What rights do I have?</strong></h3>
<p>Whether or not you’re a citizen, you have these constitutional rights:</p>
<ul><li>The Right to Remain Silent</li>
<li>The Right to be Free From “Unreasonable Searches and Seizures”</li>
<li>The Right to Advocate for Change</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Right to Remain Silent</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives every person the right not to answer questions asked by a police officer or government agent.</li>
<li>I WISH TO REMAIN SILENT.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Right to be Free From “Unreasonable Searches and Seizures”</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Fourth Amendment is supposed to protect your privacy from government intrusion. Police cannot search you, your possessions, your home, etc. unless:
<ul><li>You consent (your silence gives police consent)</li>
<li>Police obtain a search warrant</li>
<li>Or an exception to the search warrant requirement exists</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Without a warrant, police or government agents may not search your home or office without your consent, and you have the right to refuse to let them in.
<ul><li><strong>Say: I DON’T CONSENT TO THIS SEARCH</strong></li>
<li>It must be said out loud – your silence indicates to police that you consent or agree to what they are doing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Search warrant: court permission to search and seize evidence of a crime.
<ul><li>Allows police to enter your home without permission or your presence.</li>
<li>Exceptions to the search warrant requirement:
<ul><li>Weapons search within “wingspan” (car or person)</li>
<li>Exigent circumstances: “hot pursuit”</li>
<li>“Plain view” doctrine: if the public can see it, and a cop can see it, cops will be able to legally seize it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><strong>The Right to Advocate for Change</strong></p>
<ul><li>The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of groups and individuals who advocate changes in laws, government practices, and even the form of government</li>
<li>However, the ICE can target non-citizens for deportation because of the First Amendment activities, as long as it could deport them for other reasons</li>
<li>CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS CANNOT BE SUSPENDED – EVEN DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR WARTIME – AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SUSPENDED BY THE “USA PATRIOT ACT” OR ANY OTHER RECENT LEGISLATION!</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Tips for interacting with cops:</strong></h3>
<ul><li>Try and keep your hands visible at all times</li>
<li>Try to stay in well-lit places with witnesses if possible</li>
<li>You are probably being recorded by cop, especially if you end up inside cop car</li>
<li>You have the right to video or audio tape police in public as long as you tell them you are recording, and you are not interfering with an investigation.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What to do if you are stopped by the police</strong></p>
<ul><li>Remember! What you say can and will be used against you. Stay calm and in control of your words and actions. Avoid arguing with the police but firmly assert your rights.</li>
<li>Never run of physically resist even if you think that the stop is unreasonable or unlawful.</li>
<li>Ask if you are free to leave; if they say yes, do so. You are not required to provide identification if they are not detaining you (unless you are the driver of a motor vehicle).</li>
<li>NEVER CONSENT TO A SEARCH!!!</li>
<li>If you are not free to go, ask why you are being detained
<ul><li>You must provide name, address, and D.O.B. if detained but are not required to say anything else. It is a crime to give a false name. Police must I.D. their name, agency, and badge number.</li>
<li>You may be patted down and any possessions within your reach may be searched if police reasonably suspect you pose an imminent threat of serious physical injury.</li>
<li>Write down everything you can remember about the police interaction, including officers’ names and badge numbers.</li>
<li>DON’T CONSENT TO ANY SEARCHES</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cops Can Lie or Trick You
<ul><li>The police ARE allowed to lie to you or misinform you. Don’t be fooled.</li>
<li>Many times they will promise you that your situation will be easier if you fully cooperate or tell them what they want to know, but they do not have to follow through on their promises.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><h3><strong>Three kinds of initial police encounters:</strong></h3>
<ul><li>Conversation</li>
<li>Detention</li>
<li>Arrest</li>
</ul><p><strong>Conversation:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are under no legal obligation to have a conversation with the police, FBI, ICE, TSA, or investigator. If you agree to talk with them, you will very likely give them the information they need to arrest you or prosecute you or someone else.</li>
<li>Your best bet is to politely but firmly refuse to speak to them. Always make your refusal to speak to them clear, in words, as opposed to simply shaking your head.</li>
<li>Ask: Am I being detained? Am I free to go?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Detention:</strong></p>
<ul><li>A police officer may only detain you if he or she has a reasonable suspicion that you are involved in a crime.</li>
<li>“Reasonable suspicion” must be more than a mere hunch.</li>
<li>Police must be able to put their “reasonable suspicion” into words. Under the law, this is called the “articulable suspicion” provision.</li>
<li>Ask: Am I being detained? Why?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Arrest: Am I Under Arrest?</strong></p>
<ul><li>The police cannot move you unless you are under arrest.</li>
<li>If you are arrested, immediately ask for a lawyer. Do not respond to any police inquiries.</li>
<li>People under the age of 18 have the same rights, but normally can only be released from jail to a parent or guardian.</li>
<li>If you are injured, seek medical attention and take photographs.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Arrest: So, you are going to jail</strong></p>
<ul><li>The police may arrest you if they witness you breaking the law, have probable cause to believe you have committed a crime, or have an arrest warrant, signed by a judge, for your arrest.</li>
<li>If you commit an act of nonviolent civil disobedience, then you have broken the law – most likely in front of police officers – and therefore they may arrest you because they witnessed it.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Arrest: Searches</strong></p>
<ul><li>When making an arrest, the police are allowed to search you “to the skin.”</li>
<li>They may search your bags, and may search your vehicle.</li>
<li>An officer searching your body must be of your own gender.</li>
<li>Transdermal piercings may be removed.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Arrest: Assert Your Rights!</strong></p>
<ul><li>“I am going to remain silent, and I want to contact an attorney.”
<ul><li>This phrase immediately invokes your constitutional Fifth Amendment rights which protect you from police interrogation. Once you utter these words, the police are legally required to stop questioning you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even if you don’t already have an attorney, police must provide you with a phonebook. Invoking your right to have an attorney present is a fundamental right!</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Miranda Rights</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have the right to remain silent and to refuse to answer questions.</li>
<li>Anything you do say can and will be used against you in a court of law.</li>
<li>You have the right to an attorney and to have an attorney present when questioned.</li>
<li>If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you at no charge.</li>
<li>If you decide to answer questions now, without an attorney present, you will retain the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney.</li>
<li>Do you understand these rights as explained to you?</li>
<li>Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Your “Demand of Rights”</strong></p>
<ul><li>I will not talk to you or anyone about anything.</li>
<li>I demand to have an attorney present before I speak to you or anyone.</li>
<li>I will not answer any questions, or reply to any charges, without my attorney present.</li>
<li>I do not agree to perform any test, consent to any searches, or participate in any line-ups, except DUI tests that don’t involve words.</li>
<li>I will not sign anything unless my attorney agrees I should do so, except jail release agreement.</li>
<li>I will not waive any of my constitutional rights.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Grand Juries</strong></p>
<ul><li>A subpoena to a grand jury is a written order for you to appear at a secret court proceeding and testify under oath about information the government believes you have about a crime or a fugitive.</li>
<li>You have the right to an attorney and should not speak to agents until your attorney is present. Threats are common by FBI, don’t be intimidated — assert your lawful rights!</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Sample Conversations With the Police</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Conversation</strong>
<ul><li>COP: “Hi, can I ask you a couple of questions?”</li>
<li>YOU: “Are you detaining me or am I free to go?”</li>
<li>COP: “I just want to talk to you.”</li>
<li>YOU: “I choose not to talk to you.” (you walk away)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Detention</strong>
<ul><li>COP: “Hi, can I ask you a couple of questions?”</li>
<li>YOU: “Are you detaining me or am I free to go?”</li>
<li>COP: “I’m detaining you. Hands against the wall.”</li>
<li>YOU: “Why am I being detained?” (or, “What is your reasonable suspicion?”). Memorize and report the response.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Arrest</strong>
<ul><li>COP: “I’m placing you under arrest.”</li>
<li>YOU: “I am going to remain silent. I want to contact an attorney.”</li>
<li>COP: “That’s fine. You’ll be able to contact your lawyer at the police station.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><strong>What are my rights at airports?</strong></p>
<ul><li>You gave airport personnel permission to scan you and your bags by buying a ticket and going to the airport. They can do additional random searches of persons and property regardless of whether the initial scan turns up anything suspicious.</li>
<li>If the scan does disclose something that might be a weapon, the law is unclear whether you have the right to leave the airport rather than being searched.</li>
<li>The airplane pilot can refuse to fly a passenger if he or she believes the passenger is a threat to the safety of the flight. And if you are entering the country, the U.S. Customs Service has the right to stop and search every person and item.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What are my rights at borders?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Within 500 miles of a border your constitutional rights are greatly reduces</li>
<li>This area of the law is constantly changing right now….</li>
</ul><h3><strong>What if I am not a citizen and the ICE contacts me?</strong></h3>
<ul><li>ICE CANNOT ENTER YOUR HOME WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ANSWER THE DOOR OR SPEAK TO AN ICE AGENT.</li>
<li>Assert your rights. Failure to demand your rights may result in a waiver of your rights.</li>
<li>Do not rely on agents or family members to translate important legal information. Demand Interpreter.</li>
<li><strong>Talk to a lawyer</strong></li>
<li>You are not entitled to a free lawyer if you cannot afford one.</li>
<li>You have the right to an interpreter who speaks your native language. Do not sign papers without a lawyer.</li>
<li>Always carry the name and telephone number of an immigration lawyer and who will take your calls. You must carry your immigration papers such as “green card,” I-94, or work authorization with you as well.</li>
<li><strong>The immigration laws are complex and changing. ICE will not explain your options to you. As soon as you encounter an ICE agent, call your attorney.</strong></li>
</ul><strong>What to do if you are detained</strong>
<ul><li>You do not have to answer questions about your immigration status or any other questions.</li>
<li>In most cases, you have the right to a hearing before an immigration judge before you can be deported.</li>
<li>If you are a foreign national arrested in the U.S., you have the right to call your consulate or to have the police inform the consulate of your arrest.</li>
</ul><strong>Deportation issues</strong>
<ul><li>Parents: After 6 months of detention, the state is permitted to place your children up for adoption and terminate your parental rights.</li>
<li>Set up emergency arrangements. Sign a power of attorney giving someone you know the power to care for your children in your absence so they do not end up in the system.</li>
<li>You may be able to post bail if detained.</li>
</ul>Do everything you can to prevent deportations: Don’t drive if your car isn’t in legal compliance with driving laws, and don’t drive drunk.]]>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 15 min<div class="row col-sm-12"><p>by <a href="https://poolp.org/author/gilles.html">gilles</a> [<a href="mailto:gilles@poolp.org">@</a>], on the 2019-08-30 12:00:00+02:00</p></div><div class="row col-sm-12"><div class="highlight"><pre>TL;DR:
- Mail is not hard: people keep repeating that because they read it, not because they tried it
- Big Mailer Corps are quite happy with that myth, it keeps their userbase growing
- Big Mailer Corps control a large percentage of the e-mail address space which is good for none of us
- It's ok that people have their e-mails hosted at Big Mailer Corps as long as there's enough people outside too
</pre></div><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>I work on an opensource SMTP server. I build both opensource and proprietary solutions related to mail. I will likely open a commercial mail service next year.</p><p>In this article, I will voluntarily use the term <code>mail</code> because it is vague enough to encompass protocols and software. This is not a very technical article and I don’t want to dive into protocols, I want people who have never worked with mail to understand all of it.</p><p>I will also not explain how I achieve the tasks I describe as easy. I want this article to be about the “mail is hard” myth, disregarding what technical solution you use to implement it. I want people who read this to go read about <a href="http://www.postfix.org">Postfix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/notqmail/notqmail">Notqmail</a>, <a href="https://www.exim.org">Exim</a> and <a href="https://www.OpenSMTPD.org">OpenSMTPD</a>, and not go directly to OpenSMTPD because I provided examples.</p><p>I will write a follow-up article, this time focusing on how I do things with OpenSMTPD. If people write similar articles for other solutions, please forward them to me and I’ll link some of them. it will be updated as time passes by to reflect changes in the ecosystem, come back and check again over time.</p><p>Finally, the name Big Mailer Corps represents the major e-mail providers. I’m not targeting a specific one, you can basically replace Big Mailer Corps anywhere in this text with the name of any provider that holds several hundred of millions of recipient addresses. Keep in mind that some Big Mailer Corps allow hosting under your own domain name, so when I mention the e-mail address space, if you own a domain but it is hosted by a Big Mailer Corp, your domain and all e-mail addresses below your domain are part of their address space.</p><h2>Once upon a time, the “mail is hard” myth</h2><p>When you first look into becoming independant with your e-mails, as soon as you ask in a public tech medium for help setting up a “mail” server, people will invariably jump in the discussion to discourage you from attempting because “mail is hard”.</p><p>Not only “mail is hard” but it also seems that “Big Mailer Corps have already won”, that “all mail you send will end up in your recipients’ spam box”, and that “you will be flooded by spammers” who will “abuse your server to relay spam to the world”.</p><p>Wow, that’s overwhelming :-|</p><p>You just wanted to send and receive mail because it seemed like a good idea, and now this turned into the worst life decision. But is it ?</p><h2>Software is hard</h2><p>Mail used to be hard. A long long time ago.</p><p>It was hard because software were hard to setup correctly. A mail server like Sendmail required a Ph.D in compilers theory to operate, and the elitist culture of postmasters who could read Sendmail’s so-called “configuration files” didn’t help create a user-friendly environment. Postmasters bragging about how hard Sendmail was, while disclosing their unconditional love for m4 was a pissing contest. I can easily imagine these people whipping themselves with fresh nettles as a hobby.</p><p>Postfix is an alternative to Sendmail that has been around since 1998. While I wouldn’t consider it as “simple” by any stretch of the word, it is <strong>orders of magnitude</strong> simpler than Sendmail. With the help of a search engine, new comers will easily find tutorials to spot the <strong>three or four</strong> configuration options they need to tweak.</p><p>OpenSMTPD is another alternative which was first released in 2013. It is also <strong>orders of magnitude</strong> simpler than Sendmail. The configuration reads almost as plain english and a usable configuration file can actually fit … <strong>in a tweet</strong>.</p><p><img alt="OpenSMTPD config fitting in a tweet" src="https://poolp.org/theme/images/2019-08-30-tweet.png" width="100%" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><a href="https://poolp.org/theme/images/2019-08-30-tweet.png">full screen</a></p><p>I don’t have experience in other contenders, but most operating systems and distributions provide multiple alternatives, pre-packaged so you can install and run with a simple command.</p><p>Mail software is NOT hard. It was if you stopped looking in the 90’s.</p><h2>OK, software isn’t hard but dealing with SPAM is</h2><p>The myth goes on by saying that mail is hard because as soon as you run your mail server, spammers are going to come in hordes and dealing with spam will become a daily nightmare. This could not be further from the truth.</p><p>Now that we’ve established trust, I’m not going to lie to you: there are hordes of spammers.</p><p>When you plug your server in to the internet, you’ll start seeing connections from random sources trying to get mail accross. You’ll see them coming from home connections, from remote countries, from IP addresses sharing the same range, there will be no end to how much amazement this will procure.</p><p>Basically, they all fit in two categories:</p><ul><li>clients trying to abuse your server to use it as a relay to send spam to the world</li>
<li>clients trying to send spam to you after having obtained your e-mail address somehow</li>
</ul><p>The ones from the first category are easy to deal with: <strong>IGNORE THEM</strong>. They search for misconfigured servers and try doing things that will be rejected on a properly configured server, or even try to authenticate with a dictionnary attack which is not going to succeed if you have good passwords. They are like mosquitoes on a summer evening, annoying but… meh.</p><div class="highlight"><pre>c1a89cb774083905 smtp connected address=185.234.219.64 host=&lt;unknown&gt;

</pre></div><p>If they really, really bother you or you dislike logs full of such attempts, write a script that detects such patterns in logs and add them to your firewall. Out of pure laziness, I have never ever used scripts to deal with these in the twenty years I operated mail servers and I’m still here to talk about it. As long as you don’t see them succeeding anything, you can just disregard these.</p><p>The ones from the second category are slighly more annoying because if you ignore them, your mailbox becomes full of spam. Luckily, they are not so hard to filter through several <strong>simple</strong> means and it is very easy to reduce spam to a few, every now and then, properly classified in a Spam folder (also known as “junked” mails). I take absolutely no precaution hiding my e-mail address, <a href="mailto:gilles@poolp.org">gilles@poolp.org</a>, and I sometimes get one or two spam e-mails per day in the junk folder. Not only is that not a daily nightmare, but it’s less than what I actually receive on my own Big Mailer Corps account, which I do not share as easily and which has an average of three to five daily junked mails.</p><p>Note that some very simple filters you’d apply for the second category of spammers, are HIGHLY effective to also kill the spammers from the first category:</p><div class="highlight"><pre>a56dece24dcac3d2 smtp failed-command command="DATA" result="550 message rejected"
a56ded3dd6cda8c2 smtp failed-command command="" result="550 your IP reputation is too low for this MX"
a56ded3f7db5b96c smtp failed-command command="DATA" result="550 message rejected"
a56dec6ffdb2caef smtp failed-command command="" result="421 you must have rDNS to contact this MX"
a56dec895475b9bf smtp failed-command command="" result="421 you must have FCrDNS to contact this MX"
</pre></div><p>I’ll just state it as it is: <strong>You will never reach “absolute 0 spam”</strong>, it was proven mathematically in the 2000s, but the amount you’ll receive while self-hosted can be as low or lower as what you receive at Big Mailer Corps. Spam is not more of an issue self-hosted, no matter how much the marketing tries to tell you otherwise.</p><p>To illustrate this I emptied the Spam folder on my poolp.org account and my Big Mailer Corps account this morning, here’s the screenshot I took of both accounts tonight, poolp.org on the left and Big Mailer Corps on the right. Neither of them have spam in Inbox.</p><p><img alt="poolp.org vs Big Mailer Corps spambox" src="https://poolp.org/theme/images/2019-08-30-spambox.png" width="100%" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><a href="https://poolp.org/theme/images/2019-08-30-spambox.png">full screen</a></p><h2>OK SPAM is not the issue but my mails will not reach my users at Big Mailer Corps</h2><p>Another myth, with slightly more substance this time, is that sending e-mail to an address at a Big Mailer Corp will result in the e-mail being rejected or junked.</p><p>Let me tell you a secret: Big Mailer Corps are not worried about you but are worried about big senders harassing their users. They do not care about your personal server sending a few mails, even if its in the thousands per months. What they care about is the infected computers or compromised servers flooding their users. What they care about are the marketing companies that are literally shitting over them, sending individually millions of commercial mails per day, trying to work-around spam filters, and that sometimes manage to go for a while without being rejected. Unless you are sending hundreds of thousands of mails to them on a daily basis, quite frankly and without trying to hurt your feelings, you fall waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay below the radars.</p><p><img alt="inbox at various Big Mailer Corps" src="https://poolp.org/theme/images/2019-08-30-bigmailercorps.png" width="100%" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><a href="https://poolp.org/theme/images/2019-08-30-bigmailercorps.png">full screen</a></p><p>So why did I say this claim has more substance than the others ?</p><p>Big Mailer Corps have introduced proof-of-work into mail exchanges, voluntarily or not.</p><p>Unlike legitimate senders who want to reach a specific user, spammers want to reach a ton of users whoever they are, because statistically some of them are going to fall for whatever it is that they’re trying to sell. Among these spammers, we’ll also include marketing companies that buy lists of users from partners, sending indiscriminately to “activate” them in hope of reaching some percentage of openings. They don’t care who receives an e-mail as long as it opens, because you know, statistics. So the harder it is for them, the higher the chance they’ll switch to another target because it’s the only way to not fall behind statistically. Don’t think I’m making this up, you’d be amazed at what tricks and hacks are used to mechanically increase openings by a few percents, including lowering the number of recipients at a particular destination and increasing at another.</p><p>In opposition to this are legitimate users who can’t just switch to another target, they want to reach a specific recipient and, if work is needed to achieve that, well… you got to do what you got to do. They’ll pour in the work needed to make it work.</p><p>Knowing this, Big Mailer Corps came with sets of rules about what a Good Sender should do to be able to communicate with them. These lists are basically a proof of work: they do not guarantee that you’ll be able to send to them, they do not guarantee that you’ll hit the inbox and will not be junked, but they are the minimal set of things you should do to prove you actually care. And considering some spammers do their best to look good, if you don’t do it yourself it basically means you’re not even willing to do better than spammers.</p><p>These rules are not only here to annoy you, they are also very effective: some of the rules cannot be achieved for spammers who use compromised hosts, for example. This proof of work paradigm is annoying because it raises (in time) the cost of entry, but it can also be leveraged by others to kill spam. Since Good Senders most definitely want to be able to send to Big Mailer Corps, if you receive connections from clients that didn’t do the minimum to deliver there, you can shut them down yourself because they’re already cut from a big portion of the e-mail address space.</p><p>This is why I wrote this has more substance than the other claims. It’s true that <strong>IF</strong> you don’t even try to do the minimum work, <strong>THEN</strong> you’ll start with a penalty.</p><p>In practice, a notion of reputation is also into play. Some people don’t even try but they fall but fall sooooooo far below the radars… that even without trying they’ll manage to send e-mails without issues. I often send mail to my Big Mailer Corp account from my development laptop, far from being properly configured, and they almost always reach inbox. A good reputation allows you to make some mistakes and go through without respecting all rules, while bad reputation increases the amount of work you need to do. Considering that a good reputation is earned from doing things right, you get the general idea: do things right.</p><p>The minimum set rules is <strong>VERY FAR</strong> from being hard. To quote someone on twitter:</p><p><img alt="rDNS + SPF/DKIM and you're golden" src="https://poolp.org/theme/images/2019-08-30-tweet_2.png" width="100%" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><a href="https://poolp.org/theme/images/2019-08-30-tweet_2.png">full screen</a></p><p>I would add a few things to that list but this highlights that some people are already “golden”, just by setting up proper rDNS, SPF and DKIM. That last bit about handling incoming spam, we’ve already discussed it above ;-)</p><h2>OK, then why is everyone saying it’s hard ?</h2><p>The first reason, is because no one claims otherwise and, since Big Mailer Corps benefits from this situation, they’re not going to contradict it either. Big Mailer Corps <strong>BENEFIT</strong> from the myth that mail is hard as this means more people rely on them, they control more of the e-mail address space, and this translates to more e-mails being analyzed for targeted advertisement. The more people are discouraged, the more people will eventually subscribe to their services, and since they already control a large share, they can make mail slighly more difficult by making their requirements higher (harder, not hard). This is <strong>not</strong> something they do in some kind of conspiracy, this is just the result of them obtaining more power because people stay away from self hosting.</p><p>Another reason is because it used to be hard a long time ago. People got traumatized by how hard it was to not screw up and never reevaluated the situation. Some people today genuinely discourage other people from running their mail server, citing the very real difficulties they faced over a decade ago, far before some of today’s tools even existed.</p><p>And finally, another reason is that people keep repeating it without actually trying themselves. I know this for a fact because people have been telling me that mail is hard for the last ten years, and for the last ten years I asked what they found hard in order to try improving the situation. A <strong>VAST</strong> majority of these people confessed that they never actually tried: they read or heard that mail was hard, often from a source they trusted, then accepted that claim and started telling others that mail was hard. We can’t really blame them when that myth has been around for so long, if I had no previous knowledge of mail and did a quick search today to find out how to setup my server, I might just decide not to do it given how difficult it seems from reading others.</p><h2>What do we do from now ?</h2><p>We need to reclaim mail. I’m not saying people shouldn’t be hosted at Big Mailer Corps, but these should not become the Pavlovian reaction to “where do I get an e-mail address ?”.</p><p>As long as there are enough mail hosts out there, Big Mailer Corps <strong>HAVE</strong> to remain friendly because their users can complain that their legitimate mail is junked, which results in a risk of them leaving for elsewhere, less e-mails, less targeted advertisement, less $$$. If the number of mail hosts shrinks to the point that trafic not coming from Big Mailer Corps is irrelevant, then it becomes their protocols and they can start making up rules that are not sustainable by anyone but them, because no one will notice when the insignificant number of e-mails not coming from there is junked. Again, <strong>not</strong> a conspiracy but a side effect of being the few relevant actors of a system: why bother abiding to standards that work for everyone and ensuring any sender can reach them… if most of the trafic comes from a handful of actors.</p><p>This is already happening with one specifically requiring mails to be sent from another Big Mailer Corp to hit the inbox, or requiring that senders be added to the contacts for others. Any other sender will hit spambox unconditionnally for a while before being eventually upgraded to inbox.</p><p>We can’t let that happen: allowing e-mail to be fully controlled by a small set of cooperating multi-million users hosts is just accepting to be screwed.</p><p>It is therefore very important that we don’t let the myth propagate further. Our best interest is to have a WIDE variety of mail hosts and providers, small and big, commercial and not. We must not allow the number of mail hosts to shrink, they must increase so the e-mail address space out of the control of Big Mailer Corps remains significant.</p><p>And by all means, <strong>we must not push everyone to use Big Mailer Corps</strong>, particularly because a lot of people simply read their e-mail from a smartphone and don’t see a difference in interface, so they could be using pretty much any provider and be just as happy.</p><p>I hope my point gets accross, feel free to share this wherever you want and point people to this article.</p><p>In a few days I’ll publish a <em>practical</em> description of how to setup a host similar to mine, providing spam protection for incoming mail, and basic proof of work to make most Big Mailer Corps happy.</p><hr /><p>If you like my work, <a href="https://patreon.com/gilles">support me on patreon</a> !</p><p>Comments: <a href="https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org_posts/issues/16">https://github.com/poolpOrg/poolp.org_posts/issues/16</a></p></div>]]>

</ul></div>
<p>People often ask me about phrasing calls of submissions<strong>. Is “women + nonbinary authors” an inclusive phrasing</strong>? I am going to share my thoughts both as as a writer and as an editor.</p>
<p>I have noticed a trend where <strong>more and more venues change their phrasing to “women + nonbinary” only to then revert back to “women only”</strong> after a period of time. This can be very difficult for nonbinary authors they published in the meanwhile who are not women. (Including, occasionally, me.)</p>
<p>I used to say that “women + nonbinary” can be acceptable as a phrasing, even if not ideal. In the light of this recent trend, <strong>I changed my mind and no longer recommend such calls for submission</strong>. Nonbinary people can be and often are very rapidly erased from such phrasings.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, these calls all start out as “women only” calls and venues add “+ nonbinary” in response to criticism of their exclusionary nature. But as the trend of reverting the addition shows, <strong>the added nonbinary inclusion is more often than not just an afterthought, a surface language change</strong>. Nonbinary and/or other trans people are not centered or even emphasized in these calls. We never see “nonbinary people and women,” only “women and nonbinary” – even the “people” is often missing, though nonbinary is not a noun, it’s an adjective.</p>
<p>I put my thoughts together in a FAQ format. <strong>This is not the be-all-end-all of nonbinary inclusion in calls for submissions, just my thoughts as someone who is a writer and editor</strong> who gets asked all these questions frequently.</p>
<hr /><p><strong>I generally do this type of consulting for money. I made this as a free resource</strong> for the community; also I can’t be there at every venue, nor would they be willing or able to pay me 🙂 If you’d like to show your support with money, here are some ways:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/bogiperson">Patreon</a> for regular monthly support (this also gets you a lot of other resources!)</li>
<li><a href="https://ko-fi.com/A380KOB">Ko-fi</a> for one-time support</li>
<li><a href="http://a.co/7XIYcbR">Amazon wishlist</a> if you would like to get me physical objects (I have a mailbox if you do not want to use Amazon)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bogireadstheworld.com/hire-me/">Hire me</a> if you have work for me</li>
</ul><hr /><p><strong>What are some of the problems with “women + nonbinary”?</strong></p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list, just some ideas that I’ve heard discussed:</p>
<ul><li>It conflates nonbinary people with women, when many nonbinary people are transmasculine / nonbinary men / etc. …leading transmasculine nonbinary people not to submit.</li>
<li>Sometimes editors do not include any transfeminine people (trans women, transfeminine nonbinary people, etc.) in these calls, and often they are not transparent about this, making one to have to guess. …leading transfeminine nonbinary people not to submit. (And in my experience, trans women authors often avoid these calls altogether.)</li>
<li>It doesn’t necessarily include intersex people, who are marginalized on the basis of sex, but not necessarily gender.</li>
<li>It doesn’t necessarily include people of culturally specific sexes / genders.</li>
<li>In practice it often excludes nonbinary people who are neither masculine nor feminine, though this is not explicitly stated.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What would be a better alternative?</strong></p>
<p>I tend to recommend “marginalized genders / sexes.” This includes all trans and intersex people, while also including cis non-intersex women. It also includes nonbinary people in general.</p>
<p>An alternate can be “underrepresented,” and I think this works just as fine as “marginalized.” I think they have subtly different emphases. “Underrepresented” refers to the current <em>situation</em>, while “marginalized” refers to the <em>process</em> of marginalizing. “Marginalized” is also more explicit about people being actively excluded. You can also just use both terms.</p>
<p>“Minorities” is not as handy, I think, because women by and large are not necessarily a minority, even though they are both often marginalized and underrepresented.</p>
<p>“Marginalized genders / sexes” also offers an opportunity to include people who have culturally specific genders / sexes (if they would like to be included), who are very much <em>not</em> included in “women and nonbinary” or even “trans” unless they are <em>also</em> women, nonbinary or trans.</p>
<p>Finally, this varies from call to call, but I’d also specifically highlight groups I feel the need to encourage to submit. Please also read Rose Lemberg’s essay in Strange Horizons about <a href="http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/columns/encouraging-diversity-an-editors-perspective/">encouraging diversity as an editor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What about phrasings which refer to people who identify as women in some way?</strong></p>
<p>If the call focuses <em>specifically</em> on the experiences related to womanhood, I think this is generally fine and not exclusionary! There should absolutely be projects that center womanhood, femininity, femme experiences (which are all terms with different, but related meanings). There are at present very few such projects that are trans-inclusive, especially in speculative fiction, unless they are produced by trans women / transfeminine people with an <em>explicitly</em> trans focus, like <em>Maiden, Mother, and Crone: Fantastical Trans Femmes</em>; Trans Women Writers Collective projects, etc. The same is true of masculinities, despite the newly upcoming exception of <em>Speculative Masculinities</em>. So yes, I feel that more projects focusing on women / femininity / femme-ness would be wonderful. But the particulars can often be difficult when a wide range of experiences is sought.</p>
<p>For example, if you as an editor are a cis woman, this makes you the arbiter of womanhood, and trans women / transfeminine authors will often be wary of submitting work. This is a justified wariness – many such calls are produced by trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs) who are violently opposed to trans women.</p>
<p>I would say you as a cis woman editor can <em>only</em> counteract people’s wariness to an extent by reaching out to trans women / transfeminine authors and soliciting work from them, and developing a history of publishing work from such authors. People will and do look at previous tables of contents that you edited to determine whether it is even worth trying to submit work to you.</p>
<p><strong>Why not just use “no cis men”?</strong></p>
<p>This phrasing excludes intersex cis men, who are very much a marginalized group and generally not included in most places.</p>
<p>(Note that some intersex men who were assigned male at birth identify as ipsogender instead of cis, because cis does not carry the meaning of oppression that they experience. But some of these people do identify as cis. And phrasings as “no cis men” can be alienating to intersex people regardless of the subtleties of how they identify, because in general non-intersex editors are entirely unaware of these distinctions.)</p>
<p>It also implies that trans men are not <em>really</em> men, even if the intent seems to be that trans men are “the good ones”. So this phrase is both cis- and intersexist.</p>
<p><strong>Why not just use “women and femmes”?</strong></p>
<p>I have seen this used in ways where it means exactly what one thinks it means on the surface – which I think is fine! -, but think using “women and femmes” can also be misleading in multiple ways, and it is good to be mindful of that.</p>
<p>First, many women (both trans and cis) are not femme, but are butch, masculine-of-center, etc. or just do not identify as femme for some reason. Emphasizing femmes makes them wary of submitting that they have to provide a more cisnormative women’s experience.</p>
<p>There are also femme men, both trans and cis. I have asked some of the more outspoken femme men in SFF about this topic in the past, and they generally do not feel comfortable submitting work to such calls. The editorial intention often seems to be that these calls are not open to men, regardless of their gender presentation.</p>
<p>I have also seen cis women use “women and femmes” to exclude trans women and nonbinary transfeminine people from womanhood. So to say that they can be included under “femme”, but not under “woman”. I very much disagree with this interpretation of the term, but it sadly exists. In that sense it kind of replaced the now less frequently seen “women and trans women” or “women and women-identified people” or even “women and people who identify as women”. (Which are all transmisogynist phrasings and are to be avoided.)</p>
<p>There are also nonbinary people who are not femme. I am sometimes solicited for such calls, and it is a very uncomfortable discussion every time where I have to explain that I am not a woman or femme, and often that I’m specifically not a trans woman. This often results in me having to disclose my birth assignment, sex and gender history, because these editors insist on me clarifying why I do not identify as woman or femme (instead of taking my word). No one should have to do that to submit to a venue. But if I as a well-known author still feel like I have to explain myself, all the more so will newer authors.</p>
<p>For the record, this is all publicly available information about me: I am a nonbinary agender person. I am intersex and was assigned female at birth. (Almost all intersex people are assigned a binary sex at birth.) Many people read me as transfeminine based on my looks (I had a mixed puberty and my body didn’t agree with hormone replacement), but I am not. I also have a culturally specific sex I will not disclose to an editor, at all. ….I hope now it is more apparent why guessing people’s identity instead of asking is not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Why not just use “gender and sexual minorities”?</strong></p>
<p>This includes people marginalized on the basis of sexual <em>orientation</em>, but does not include many women (women are not a minority). It also doesn’t necessarily include intersex people. It is basically a term that means something entirely different.</p>
<p><strong>Why do editors do this?</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to say.</p>
<p>As I’ve said in the introduction, I think the intent is to produce women-only calls without looking trans-exclusionary, but with only a minimum of effort.</p>
<p>Most venues I’ve consulted on this say that “women + nonbinary” is more succinct than what I have always recommended, authors of “marginalized [or underrepresented] genders / sexes”. I hope we agree that succinctness is not a good reason to be exclusionary.</p>
<p>Venues generally do not provide reasons for dropping “nonbinary” later on.</p>
<p>I can only speculate based on my experiences, and I can say that I think it happens for different reasons at different venues.</p>
<ul><li>Sometimes inclusive phrasings are pushed by one person at a venue. If that person leaves, or does not feel like they can convince the other people at the venue, this results in more exclusion. (I have recently seen a sad example where a project was promoted as “marginalized genders” by one of its two editors and “women only” by the other editor.)</li>
<li>Sometimes venues are criticized for “women and nonbinary”, for the reasons I described above, and they decide that inclusion is too much trouble. Instead of using a more inclusive phrasing, they just drop the (pretense of?) inclusion altogether.</li>
<li>Sometimes venues pay an inclusivity consultant and then feel like they have done their due diligence by spending money, and do not actually <em>implement</em> the suggestions of the consultant. …A sadder version is when someone consults them on it, free of charge, because they did not deem this to be worth paying for.</li>
</ul><p>And please do not forget a very big one I constantly have been mentioning in other contexts related to marginalization:</p>
<p><strong>Many venues adopt “progressive” terminology without structural change.</strong></p>
<p>Language changes are superficial. Terminology can always be quickly reverted. Structural changes cannot be easily reverted.</p>
<p>If you don’t have staff who would tell you that you are being exclusionary, and outsiders such as me have to tell you these things, you have a structural issue. Even if you have staff who are marginalized in a similar way, but they do not dare speak up because of their junior position, their situation in terms of power imbalances etc., you still have a problem.</p>
<p>We need trans editors.</p>
<p>We need transfeminine editors.</p>
<p>We need transmasculine editors.</p>
<p>We need nonbinary editors.</p>
<p>We need intersex editors.</p>
<p>We need editors who are multiply marginalized, and not just on the basis of sex/gender.</p>
<p>We need editors whose gender or sex does not fit Anglo-Western norms.</p>
<p>We need all of us, together.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<hr /><p>Thank you to those who anonymously offered their comments to the draft. I am now opening this to general comments (my comments are always moderated) and very much welcome your further thoughts on the matter!</p>]]>

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 12 min<h6>Photo by <a href="https://litreactor.com/photographer/jenzel-42322">Jenny Frenzel</a></h6><p>Throw away all preconceptions that you've got what it takes to make a great story by following a formula. It doesn't matter how smart you are, how high you scored on the SAT, or how prestigious your creative writing program was. Your conscious mind and your intellect cannot create a great story alone. If there's a mathematical formula for learning how to write fiction, it's probably too complicated for humans to quantify. If you've ever read a story that should "technically" be good—because it had characters who went through sufficient growth arcs, a plot that progressed at an even pace, and a lesson to be learned at the end—but it lacked a certain something, that's probably because it was built by someone who intellectualized the entire thing and didn't give it their own essence.</p><p>The writer's primary tool is not their intelligence. It is their creativity.</p><p>The essence of creativity lies in the subconscious. It is "the place where ideas come from." And it is the conscious mind's relationship with the subconscious that allows creative people to create great stories.</p><p>The subconscious is all the processes taking place in your brain that your conscious mind is not aware of. It is void-matter. It is the dream swirling underneath reality. It is your primate and your fairy brain. It is a powerful processing machine that can hold way more data and make more assessments than your conscious brain ever could. It is a lizard that crawled out of the sea with computational power greater than a supercomputer.</p><p>The subconscious is a powerful tool, and one that's necessary for humans to exist. And I've found that writers with a good relationship with their subconscious create better, more memorable stories. Because anyone can write a story. But not everyone can plug into the rhythm of the universe and ride high on the frequency waves of the inner voice powering the wheelhouse that is you.</p><p>So this is the article for you if you're:</p><ul><li>stuck and unable to come up with ideas</li>
<li>feel like you're creating boring and plain stories</li>
<li>not writing as deeply or thoughtfully as you want to</li>
<li>or you just want some new techniques to store in the good ole' mindbank</li>
</ul><p>If any of the above apply to you, here's what you can do.</p><h2>Stop</h2><p>That's it. Just stop.</p><p>Throw away all preconceptions that you've got what it takes to make a great story by following a formula.</p><p>The first thing you must do when you're frustrated, tired, grinding your teeth, furrowing your brow, brain dead, and creatively blocked is to stop.</p><p>Allow your mind to let go of the problem that you're working on.</p><p>You can visualize it as a clenched fist relaxing if you want. Whatever you need to do to direct your focus away from the problem.</p><p>Creativity works best when you're not hyper focused on whatever you're trying to solve, as it utilizes a different part of the brain. Brainstorming, mind maps, and other creative tools are all well and good, but when you've been banging your head against a metaphorical (I hope metaphorical) wall for hours, the best thing you can do for your writing and your mind is to cease and desist.</p><p>Breathe. Step away from the computer. Go get a snack or take a shower. Sometimes you'll find that's all you need to get unblocked — just a few minutes of blissful, unrepentant quiet inside your own skull</p><p>But if that doesn't work, move on to some of the other techniques below.</p><h2>Go Mind fishing</h2><p>This is sort of like a guided meditation. You go to a quiet, comfortable place with no screens and close your eyes and think about the project you're working on. Allow the images to come to you without latching on to a particular one. Allow the images to move and flow, like waves. You can zoom in and out of particular scenes that interest you, but try to avoid thinking too hard or fixating on one idea. The point of this exercise is to allow your brain to roam freely, and to think alongside vectors you normally wouldn’t.</p><p>This is difficult to do because it's boring. You will have to sit alone in the quiet, and if you're not used to doing this it will drive you crazy. We like stimulation — music, television, big sparkly showers of fireworks. While those activities are engaging, they don’t give you much space to actually think about your writing. That’s why if you can manage to do this exercise for even ten minutes, it often yields great results that would normally take days.</p><h2>Shake up Your Routine</h2><p>The human brain likes habits and patterns. We rely on a sort of mental shorthand, because making decisions is a lot of effort. So we create shortcuts in an effort to expend less mental energy. We drink at the same coffee shop. We part our hair on the same side of our head. We reach for the same brand of bread at the grocery store.</p><p>This is all well and good for normal, everyday things. Like imagine having to weigh the pros and cons of which bread brand you should get every time you went to the store, and how much time that would take for the small amount of benefit it would provide. If we all did this, the human race would’ve died out a long time ago.</p><p>But routine can be a numbing agent for creativity. If we see the same people, go to the same places, listen to the same music, and write in the same place at the same time — we’re not providing ourselves new sensory input for creativity to work with. Sometimes all it takes to get hit with a burst of new inspiration is to take your laptop outside on the patio, or write in the morning instead of at night.</p><p>You don’t even have to change up your writing routine. Your subconscious is complex and sophisticated, and it can do creative work (often its best creative work) when you’re not even thinking about it. Do something new. It doesn’t have to be too crazy. Just different enough from what you normally do to make it a novel experience. Go to a new park. Find a different route home. Kiss a stranger (if the stranger be willing). Hell, buy a different brand of bread. Buy a different type of bread! Shoot for the damn moon.</p><p>The point of shaking up your routine is that your brain will be forced to be more alert, and seek out new connections. If you do something different it can’t rely on autopilot, but must make deliberate decisions. This can give you that <em>aha!</em> moment. Sort of like blowing the dust off your mind keyboard.</p><p>Don’t expect this to work every time, because it won’t. The subconscious doesn’t follow ordinary rules, and finding new ideas or adding juice to a story is more akin to a magical process than science. But sometimes, this is just the kind of thing writers need.</p><p>I think of changing up my routine every so often as a sort of writer hygiene. People need to brush their teeth and wash their hair. Writers need to read books, write, and occasionally shake up their routine to provide new data and form different connections.</p><p>But I mean, yeah, wash your hair too.</p><h2>Find the Rhythm</h2><p>It's always difficult to talk about the processes of the subconscious, because it exists in a place beyond language. We have to use things like metaphors and personification to attempt to understand them in ways we can communicate to others. So oftentimes talking about the subconscious can come off as a bit hokey or mystical, when really it's because we don't have the language to articulate it perfectly.</p><p>So what I'm about to say is going to sound a little crazy or woo-woo, unless you've done it yourself. But like I said above, working with the subconscious is more like magic than science. Because magic is just science that we don’t fully understand yet.</p><p>If you listen, you can tap into the flow of your writing and hear its rhythm before you've even thought of the words themselves. It's like a low grade hum that begins to take shape underneath the blankness. Or you can "feel out" the landscape of the words. This requires you to be still, relax, and pay attention. It's like seeing a blank canvas and then slowly filling out the parts you want, then adding in the specific details later.</p><p>I wish I had a better technique for how to do this, but I don't. I used to think it was something I couldn't control. But now I understand that the better I know my characters, the story, and what I want to achieve, the more clear the rhythm is. If I can't hear the rhythm, it's either because I'm tired or I don't understand something about the story. So I go back over each piece, like taking apart a machine and cleaning each component, so I can figure out what's missing and then put it back together again.</p><p>When you're able to find the music to the words you're writing, you'll be able to tap into the flow and write with a greater proficiency and creativity than you could when you painstakingly think about word choice. It's a little bit like dancing. When we dance, we're performing complicated math, but we don't actually think about it. If you were to stop and think about how your limbs were moving, you might find it extremely difficult to dance at all. So it is with writing.</p><p>You also need to have a good solid foundation of vocabulary and grammar to do this. And you need to feed your subconscious enough written works so it knows how words should flow correctly.  If you're reading this article, I assume that you already do.</p><h2>Take A Shot</h2><p>This doesn't work for everyone, but sometimes a shot of vodka can help you loosen up enough to stop over-intellectualizing your work. Or you can microdose. Can I recommend that? Whatever.</p><h2>Go Beyond the First Level of Your Imagination</h2><p>I also talk about this technique in my LitReactor article, "<a href="https://litreactor.com/columns/how-to-write-edgy-fiction-without-being-obnoxious">How to Write Edgy Fiction Without Being Obnoxious</a>," so I'll keep this one brief.</p><p>You want to access your subconscious so you can write fresh, engaging fiction that isn't just a rehash of every other thing you've ever written. But your brain is lazy. This is a good thing, because laziness equals efficiency. But that means oftentimes if you go with the first idea for a story, it’ll be a repetitive cliche.</p><p>Pixar writers also uses this technique. You discard the first idea that pops into your brain, and think up 6 or 7 more. The 6th idea is more likely to be interesting and unique, as opposed to the first.</p><p>Not everyone can plug into the rhythm of the universe and ride high on the frequency waves of the inner voice powering the wheelhouse that is you.</p><h2>Starve it Out (With Sheer Boredom)</h2><p>I think writer's block is "real" in the sense that some days you are stuck and don't know what to do or how to move forward, but at the same time I understand those writers who claim it's not real, that it's a made-up malaise. Because you're never really "out of ideas," after all. If you were truly out of ideas, you'd be dead.</p><p>The mind is an idea machine. It's designed for stimulus — to the point where we'll hallucinate if left in a sensory deprivation tank or sustain brain damage if left in social isolation for too long. And when you dream, you dream vivid constructions that take data from reality and create elaborate scenarios because your brain never truly shuts off.</p><p>If you want to think of an idea, all you have to do is wait.</p><p>Let's be real here, there's a reason people talk about "writing a novel someday," and then never do it. It’s because there are about a thousand more exciting things to do than writing. Writing is a "low reward" type activity, in that it doesn't provide that same exciting stimulation as watching a show, reading, dancing, or cooking. When you cook a meal, you can have something to eat in about ten minutes to an hour — a quick reward for your efforts. When you're writing, the actual act is often like meditation with a keyboard. Maybe you'll have a story finished in anywhere from a week to several years, and after that you have to wait months to maybe get it published somewhere.</p><p>But if you can force yourself to sit down in front of your computer, set a timer for an hour, and then not get out of your chair until time is up — you’ll be surprised at what kind of ideas your brain will be forced to come up with out of sheer boredom.</p><h2>Head in The Direction of Your Fear</h2><p>Sometimes the thing that will take your writing to the next level, that will elevate your work, is the very thing you’re afraid to write.</p><p>We marvel at the courage of writers who can write about the things we often don’t even allow ourselves to think. Because they have delved down into their subconscious and tapped into a fear that many people have, but instead of turning away from it they've hauled it up into the light. Because the thoughts we are afraid of aren’t usually pretty. They’re messy, vulnerable</p><p>But they’re real. And that’s what resonates. And oftentimes the more real you are, the more in tune with your subconscious you are, and the better your writing will become.</p><p>Sometimes you feel blocked because the thing you want to write about makes you afraid, and it clouds your judgement and makes you less efficient. Because trying to avoid realness and the fear that comes with it makes you stiff and awkward as you try to write around whatever it is you want to avoid.</p><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>Your ongoing success as a writer depends on your relationship with your subconscious. It’s a dance, one in which you never quite know all the steps. All you can do is go with the flow, work with it, feed it stimuli, and be patient.</p><p>Not all of these tricks will work for every writer. Some may work only part of the time. But as you continue to listen to your subconscious, you’ll often find that the lines of communication open up just a little bit wider, and your relationship with that part of your brain will improve.</p>]]>

<li>Abnormal panting can be a sign of illness or emotional distress</li>
<li>There are many causes of abnormal panting, some of which include heatstroke, pain, Cushing’s disease, and anxiety or phobias</li>
</ul></div></div></div><div class="bodytextdiv" id="bodytext"><p><strong>By Dr. Becker</strong></p><p>If you've spent any time around dogs, you know they pant. In fact, many dogs pant a lot. Panting describes a type of rapid, shallow breathing that speeds evaporation of water from your dog's tongue, and inside his mouth and upper respiratory tract. As the water evaporates, it helps your dog regulate his body temperature.</p><p>This is necessary because as his body temp rises, his skin doesn't sweat like a human's does. He's able to sweat a bit through his paw pads, but it's panting that allows him to circulate air through his body most efficiently.</p><p>The normal (non-panting) breathing rate for dogs is 30 to 40 inhalations and exhalations per minute, but a panting dog can take 10 times that many breaths per minute (300 to 400). You would think panting uses up a lot of energy, but it actually doesn't require much effort thanks to the natural elasticity of the lungs and airways.</p><h2>Normal and Abnormal Panting</h2><p>There are two types of panting: normal and abnormal. Normal panting typically occurs when your dog's body is overheating and is considered a natural, healthy response. Abnormal panting, on the other hand, may be a sign that your dog has a physical or emotional issue that needs further investigation.</p><p>You can tell the difference between the two types of panting by looking for these signs:</p><ul><li>Abnormal panting is excessive compared to your dog's normal panting behavior</li>
<li>It occurs during times when your dog isn't overly warm and doesn't need to cool her body down</li>
<li>It doesn't sound quite like normal panting — it may be louder or harsher, for example</li>
<li>Your dog is exerting more effort than normal while panting</li>
</ul><p>If your dog suddenly starts panting at inappropriate times or the panting seems heavier than usual, you should be concerned, but there's no need to panic. Make an appointment with your veterinarian to discuss your pet's symptoms and have him checked out.</p><h2>Causes for Abnormal Panting</h2><table class="generic-table left-align"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">
<p><strong>Overheating leading to heatstroke —</strong> The more overheated a dog becomes, the heavier he will pant. Some of the other <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2013/06/24/overheating.aspx">signs of overheating</a> include excessive thirst, elevated body temperature, glazed eyes, bright or dark red tongue or gums, and increased pulse and heartbeat.</p>
<p>If your dog's body temperature gets to 109°F or higher, heatstroke is the result. The cells of the body rapidly start to die. The brain swells, causing seizures. Lack of blood supply to the GI tract causes ulcers. Dehydration leads to irreversible kidney damage. And all these catastrophic events take place within a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>It's important for pet owners to take every precaution to prevent overheating. By the time a dog is exhibiting symptoms of heatstroke, it's often too late to save him.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<p><strong>Breed predisposition —</strong> Brachycephalic breeds, dogs with short or "pushed in" faces (e.g., Pugs, Boston Terriers, Boxers, and Bulldogs) tend to pant a lot because many have lifelong <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2012/08/22/brachycephalic-dogs-breathing-problems.aspx">breathing difficulties</a>. Due to the upper airway challenges suffered by these dogs, they often don't pant efficiently and are at significantly increased risk for heatstroke.</p>
<p>It's important to take precautions if your brachy has to travel by plane or even by car. A brachycephalic pet will have more difficulty in a hot vehicle than other pets.</p>
<p>If you have a brachy, it's important to be familiar with her normal breathing patterns so you can take quick action if the pattern changes. "Normal" for her isn't the same as it is for dogs with longer muzzles.</p>
<p>If you notice an increase, amplification, or some other change in your pet's respiratory sounds, it's important to take note of it.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<p><strong>Pain —</strong> If your dog is feeling discomfort or is dealing with a painful condition, heavy or frequent panting can be one of the first signs of trouble. If your dog is panting for no discernible reason or at odd times, for example, at night when she's normally resting, you should make an appointment with your veterinarian.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your canine companion can't tell you she's hurting, so it's up to you to notice changes in behavior that signal she could be in pain.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<p><strong>Diseases of the heart and lungs —</strong> One of the symptoms of a heart condition such as <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2012/06/18/heart-disease-causes-of-dogs.aspx">dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs</a> is excessive panting.</p>
<p>Other signs include reluctance or decreased ability to exercise, tiring quickly, increased respiration, and coughing. There may also be sudden episodes of weakness or fainting. Some dogs with heart disease have enlarged abdomens and heavy breathing due to fluid accumulation.</p>
<p>A diseased heart can't efficiently pump blood around the body, so the tissues become deprived of oxygen. Your dog's body will increase its rate of respiration to try to compensate for the lack of oxygen, and the result is panting.</p>
<p>As the heart's ability to pump declines, blood pressure in the veins behind the heart can increase. Congestion of the lungs and fluid accumulation are common, and when the lungs can no longer transfer oxygen to the bloodstream, oxygen deprivation causes the dog to breathe more rapidly and with greater force. The result is excessive panting.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<p><strong>Cushing's disease —</strong> A <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/cushings-disease-in-dogs.aspx">dog with Cushing's disease</a>, or hyperadrenocorticism, has adrenal glands that are releasing too much cortisol. Cortisol is a diverse hormone that in excessive amounts can create wide-ranging symptoms, one of the first of which is increased panting.</p>
<p>Other symptoms include increased thirst and urination, weight gain (often in spite of a reduction in calories), thinning skin, and a change in skin color from pink to grey or even black, bruising, hair loss, and irritability or restlessness.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<p><strong>Anemia —</strong> When a dog has an abnormally low volume of red blood cells and insufficient hemoglobin to carry oxygen to the body's tissues, he experiences oxygen starvation. As in the case of heart and lung disease, one of the signs of oxygen deprivation is panting.</p>
<p>Other symptoms of <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2013/01/21/anemia-symptoms.aspx">anemia</a> include weakness, lethargy, exercise intolerance, an elevated heart rate, pale mucous membranes (usually noticed in the mouth – the gums and/or tongue become pale pink to white), mental confusion, loss of appetite, rapid breathing, and collapse. If the animal is passing a large amount of digested blood from the GI tract, there will be a black tarry stool as well.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<p><strong>Laryngeal paralysis —</strong> This is a disorder in which the muscles and cartilage that open and close the larynx malfunction. When a dog with the condition breathes in, the laryngeal cartilages do not open properly, making breathing difficult. Restricted airflow and loud, raspy panting is the result.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td valign="top">
<p><strong>Anxiety, stress, fear, and phobias —</strong> Dogs who are anxious, stressed, or have noise phobias often pant. This is considered "behavioral panting" and there are usually other signs of discomfort, for example, repetitive yawning, pacing, whining or crying, lip licking, trembling, hiding, and in extreme cases, loss of bladder or bowel control.</p>
<p>Short-term reactions to stressful or unfamiliar events allow your dog to prepare to fight or take flight if necessary, and are entirely normal. However, a <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2014/02/14/dog-maladaptive-stress-response.aspx">chronic and prolonged fear response</a> can cause both physical and emotional disorders that can potentially shorten your dog's life and negatively impact his quality of life.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If you notice abnormal panting in your dog, even if she seems fine otherwise, it's important to make an appointment with your veterinarian. As with all health conditions, the sooner the problem is diagnosed and treated if necessary, the better the outcome for your four-legged companion.</p><div class="productad"><p>Advertisement</p><a id="productad" href="https://products.mercola.com/healthypets/curcumin-for-pets/?mid-curcumin-for-pets" target="_blank"><img class="mlazyload desktop-image" data-mlazyload-src="https://media.mercola.com/assets/images/mercola/mid/20190825-curcumin-pet-content-desktop.jpg" alt="​Save 41% on a Curcumin for Pets 3-Pack" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="src" /><img class="mlazyload mobile-image" data-mlazyload-src="https://media.mercola.com/assets/images/mercola/mid/20190825-curcumin-pet-content-mobile.jpg" alt="​Save 41% on a Curcumin for Pets 3-Pack" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="src" /></a><hr /></div></div><div id="bcr_divfootnote" class="sources-references"><p>+ Sources and References</p><div class="contentrefsources sourcesfoot sources" id="contentrefsources" data-jsid="sourcesReferences"><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://speakingforspot.com/blog/2015/08/02/when-is-panting-abnormal/">Spot Speaks</a></li>

											Just over a year ago,
											for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist.
											I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic.
											I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart
											and a coldness.
											And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented,
											but definitely there.
											Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,
											you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping,
											but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed,
											of a continuity between then and now.
											Coming round from
anesthesia is very different.
											I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours,
											five years or even 50 years.
											I simply wasn't there.
											It was total oblivion.
											Anesthesia —
it's a modern kind of magic.
											It turns people into objects,
											and then, we hope, back again into people.
											And in this process
											is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											How does consciousness happen?
											Somehow, within each of our brains,
											the combined activity
of many billions of neurons,
											each one a tiny biological machine,
											is generating a conscious experience.
											And not just any conscious experience —
											your conscious experience
right here and right now.
											How does this happen?
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Answering this question is so important
											because consciousness
for each of us is all there is.
											Without it there's no world,
											there's no self,
											there's nothing at all.
											And when we suffer, we suffer consciously
											whether it's through
mental illness or pain.
											And if we can experience
joy and suffering,
											what about other animals?
											Might they be conscious, too?
											Do they also have a sense of self?
											And as computers get faster and smarter,
											maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away,
											when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote.
											And I think this because
my research is telling me
											that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence
											and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms.
											Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things.
											You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											In the story I'm going to tell you,
											our conscious experiences
of the world around us,
											and of ourselves within it,
											are kinds of controlled hallucinations
											that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing
											about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness.
											Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether.
											But in fact,
											the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area.
											If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex,
											you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines
											and sometimes even philosophers.
											All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens
											and what happens when it goes wrong.
											And the strategy is very simple.
											I'd like you to think about consciousness
											in the way that we've
come to think about life.
											At one time, people thought
the property of being alive
											could not be explained
by physics and chemistry —
											that life had to be
more than just mechanism.
											But people no longer think that.
											As biologists got on with the job
											of explaining the properties
of living systems
											in terms of physics and chemistry —
											things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis —
											the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away,
											and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions,
											like a force of life or an élan vital.
											So as with life, so with consciousness.
											Once we start explaining its properties
											in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies,
											the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is
											should start to fade away.
											At least that's the plan.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											So let's get started.
											What are the properties of consciousness?
											What should a science
of consciousness try to explain?
											Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways.
											There are experiences
of the world around us,
											full of sights, sounds and smells,
											there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie.
											And then there's conscious self.
											The specific experience
of being you or being me.
											The lead character in this inner movie,
											and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly.
											Let's start with experiences
of the world around us,
											and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Imagine being a brain.
											You're locked inside a bony skull,
											trying to figure
what's out there in the world.
											There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either.
											All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses
											which are only indirectly related
to things in the world,
											whatever they may be.
											So perception —
figuring out what's there —
											has to be a process of informed guesswork
											in which the brain combines
these sensory signals
											with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is
											to form its best guess
of what caused those signals.
											The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.
											What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this.
											You might have seen this illusion before,
											but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way.
											If you look at those two patches, A and B,
											they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right?
											But they are in fact
exactly the same shade.
											And I can illustrate this.
											If I put up a second version
of the image here
											and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar,
											you can see there's no difference.
											It's exactly the same shade of gray.
											And if you still don't believe me,
											I'll bring the bar across
and join them up.
											It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all.
											This isn't any kind of magic trick.
											It's the same shade of gray,
											but take it away again,
and it looks different.
											So what's happening here
											is that the brain
is using its prior expectations
											built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex
											that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface,
											so that we see B as lighter
than it really is.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Here's one more example,
											which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions
											to change what we consciously experience.
											Have a listen to this.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Distorted voice)
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Sounded strange, right?
											Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Distorted voice)
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Still strange.
											Now listen to this.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Laughter)
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Which I do.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											So you heard some words there, right?
											Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Distorted voice)
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Yeah? So you can now hear words there.
											Once more for luck.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Distorted voice)
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											OK, so what's going on here?
											The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain
											hasn't changed at all.
											All that's changed
is your brain's best guess
											of the causes of that sensory information.
											And that changes
what you consciously hear.
											All this puts the brain
basis of perception
											in a bit of a different light.
											Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain
											from the outside world,
											it depends as much, if not more,
											on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction.
											We don't just passively
perceive the world,
											we actively generate it.
											The world we experience
comes as much, if not more,
											from the inside out
											as from the outside in.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Let me give you
one more example of perception
											as this active, constructive process.
											Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing
											to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions
											on experience.
											In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world —
											which is in this case Sussex campus —
											into a psychedelic playground.
											We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream
											to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions.
											In this case, to see dogs.
											And you can see
this is a very strange thing.
											When perceptual
predictions are too strong,
											as they are here,
											the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations
											people might report in altered states,
											or perhaps even in psychosis.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Now, think about this for a minute.
											If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception,
											then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination,
											but a controlled hallucination
											in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in
											by sensory information from the world.
											In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time,
											including right now.
											It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations,
											we call that reality.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Laughter)
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self,
											the specific experience of being you,
											is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain.
											This seems a very strange idea, right?
											Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes,
											but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me?
											For most of us,
											the experience of being a person
											is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous
											that it's difficult
not to take it for granted.
											But we shouldn't take it for granted.
											There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self.
											There's the experience of having a body
											and of being a body.
											There are experiences
of perceiving the world
											from a first person point of view.
											There are experiences
of intending to do things
											and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world.
											And there are experiences
											of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time,
											built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Many experiments show,
											and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well,
											that these different ways
in which we experience being a self
											can all come apart.
											What this means is
the basic background experience
											of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain.
											Another experience,
which just like all others,
											requires explanation.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											So let's return to the bodily self.
											How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body
											and of having a body?
											Well, just the same principles apply.
											The brain makes its best guess
											about what is and what is not
part of its body.
											And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this.
											And unlike most neuroscience experiments,
											this is one you can do at home.
											All you need is one of these.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Laughter)
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											And a couple of paintbrushes.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											In the rubber hand illusion,
											a person's real hand is hidden from view,
											and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them.
											Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush
											while the person stares at the fake hand.
											Now, for most people, after a while,
											this leads to the very uncanny sensation
											that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body.
											And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch
											on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be,
											is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess
											that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Laughter)
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											So you can measure
all kinds of clever things.
											You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses,
											but there's no need.
											It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand.
											This means that even experiences
of what our body is
											is a kind of best guessing —
											a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											There's one more thing.
											We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside,
											we also experience them from within.
											We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside.
											And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body
											are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs,
											how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like,
											lots of things.
											This kind of perception,
which we call interoception,
											is rather overlooked.
											But it's critically important
											because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body —
											well, that's what keeps us alive.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion.
											This is from our lab at Sussex.
											And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand,
											which flashes red and back
											either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat.
											And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat,
											people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body.
											So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded
											in perceiving our bodies from within.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to,
											which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different
											from experiences of the world around us.
											When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects —
											tables, chairs, rubber hands,
											people, you lot —
											even my own body in the world,
											I can perceive it
as an object from the outside.
											But my experiences
of the body from within,
											they're not like that at all.
											I don't perceive my kidneys here,
											my liver here,
											my spleen ...
											I don't know where my spleen is,
											but it's somewhere.
											I don't perceive my insides as objects.
											In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong.
											And this is important, I think.
											Perception of the internal
state of the body
											isn't about figuring out what's there,
											it's about control and regulation —
											keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds
											that are compatible with survival.
											When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there,
											we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations.
											When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things,
											we experience how well
or how badly that control is going.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											So our most basic experiences
of being a self,
											of being an embodied organism,
											are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive.
											And when we follow this idea
all the way through,
											we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences,
											since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception,
											all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive.
											We experience the world and ourselves
											with, through and because of
our living bodies.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Let me bring things together step-by-step.
											What we consciously see depends
											on the brain's best guess
of what's out there.
											Our experienced world
comes from the inside out,
											not just the outside in.
											The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences
											of what is and what is not our body.
											And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals
											coming from deep inside the body.
											And finally,
											experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation
											than figuring out what's there.
											So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it —
											well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations
											that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution
											to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity.
											We predict ourselves into existence.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this.
											First, just as we can
misperceive the world,
											we can misperceive ourselves
											when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong.
											Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,
											because we can finally
get at the mechanisms
											rather than just treating the symptoms
											in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Second:
											what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to
											a software program running on a robot,
											however smart or sophisticated.
											We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals
											whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels
											by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive.
											Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Finally,
											our own individual inner universe,
											our way of being conscious,
											is just one possible
way of being conscious.
											And even human consciousness generally —
											it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses.
											Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us,
											but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms
											shared with many other living creatures.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Now, these are fundamental changes
											in how we understand ourselves,
											but I think they should be celebrated,
											because as so often in science,
from Copernicus —
											we're not at the center of the universe —
											to Darwin —
											we're related to all other creatures —
											to the present day.
											With a greater sense of understanding
											comes a greater sense of wonder,
											and a greater realization
											that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature.
											And ...
											when the end of consciousness comes,
											there's nothing to be afraid of.
											Nothing at all.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											Thank you.
									</p></div></div><div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4"><div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4"><p>
											(Applause)

                    <![CDATA[estimated reading time: 4 min<p>Tying people up is fun! Here’s how to do it for the first time.</p><p>Communication is the key to all kinky play, and it’s absolutely essential here. Before any actual bondage takes place, talk to your activity partner about what you like, what you want to try, what you would be willing to try if they’re into it and what’s off limits. A <a href="http://thatotherpaper.com/austin/yes_no_maybe">yes/no/maybe list</a> can help. If you’ve never tied someone up or been tied up, you won’t know how you’ll react or what you’ll feel even if you think you do, and it’s okay to slow down and check in often. (If your play involves one partner saying “no” or “stop” and another ignoring it, make sure you have a verbal or physical signalling system that’s obviously out of context, such as using stoplight colors or dropping something small and loud.) The goal is to have fun, but to do that you need to stay safe, sane and consensual, and communication is important.</p>
<p>The best rope for bondage is thick cotton or silk, as neither material slides or moves around too much once you tie it off. That kind of rope is expensive though, so unless you’re ready to really invest in rope bondage, go for solid-braid nylon rope in 7/16″ or 3/8″ in diameter from any hardware store. Unlike other types of rope, the knots will stay easy to untie even after you pull them around.</p>
<p>And unlike other types of toys, rope is multi-purpose. You can make handcuffs like those below, but you can also make your own flogger, strap-on harness or belt, not to mention the infinite ways there are for restraining someone.</p>
<p>Before you begin to tie someone up, keep the following safety tips in mind:</p>
<p class="c3">+ Keep the rope loose enough that you can work two fingers between the rope and your activity partner’s skin. The goal is to restrain, not to cut off circulation. If the rope might get wet (it’s really hot and you’re both sweating, for example), leave it even looser.</p>
<p class="c3">+ Check circulation often by looking for areas of skin that might be turning blue or white. Check in with your activity partner often, and make sure they notify you if they start to feel pins and needles or numbness.</p>
<p class="c3">+ Never tie rope in a way that might restrict someone’s ability to breathe.</p>
<p class="c3">+ Never leave someone tied up alone.</p>
<p class="c3">+ Keep flat edged medical safety scissors near by in case you have to release someone quickly.</p>
<p class="c3">+ Go slowly. If you’re embarrassed to go slowly and feel self-conscious, try something like tying up your activity partner’s hands behind their back — they won’t be able to see what you’re doing or if you’re checking instructions on your phone, and going slower can feel agonizing in a good way.</p>
<p>Today’s rope handcuffs come from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L622UK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004L622UK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=autowin-20"><em>Back on the Ropes</em></a> by Two Knotty Boys, a step-by-step guide to simple and intricate rope bondage. The directions below are for tying someone’s wrists together, but you could also tie someone’s ankles together, or tie wrists to ankles, or wrists or ankles to furniture. The wrap is thick enough that it feels very solid and kind of comfortable, and you can leave ropes dangling to pull your activity partner around by or tuck them in and lead your partner around by pulling on the wrap itself. Or anything else you can think of!</p>
<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>
<p class="c3">25 feet of rope<br />A willing partner (or an upside down chair to practise on)<br />Blunt edged scissors (just in case)</p>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Have your partner hold their wrists out with about two fists of space between them. Lay the rope over their wrists so the middle of the rope is roughly between their hands. Wrap each end around twice, for a total of five wraps.</p>

<p>2. Cross the ropes beneath the handcuffs-to-be. Then bring them up and around on the opposite sides from wherever they started (the back rope over the front and the front over the back).</p>

<p>3. Wrap each end of rope around, moving towards your activity partner’s wrists. Stop winding when you still have a small gap between the wrapped rope and their skin. You should end up with an equal number of wraps on each side of the first crossed ropes. If things look a little loose, twist each side in the direction you wound it to tighten everything. You may need to wrap each end once or twice more after.</p>

<p>4. Lift the last loop on the left side and tuck the end of the rope through the resulting circle from inside to out. Repeat on the other side to tie everything off. Pull on both ends of rope to make it secure. You can either tuck the remaining ends into the wrap (if they’re short), or you can use them to tie your activity partner to something else.</p>
